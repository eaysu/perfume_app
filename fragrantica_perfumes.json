    "description": "Sauvage by Dior is a Aromatic Fougere fragrance for men. Sauvage was launched in 2015. The nose behind this fragrance is François Demachy. Top notes are Calabrian bergamot and Pepper; middle notes are Sichuan Pepper, Lavender, Pink Pepper, Vetiver, Patchouli, Geranium and elemi; base notes are Ambroxan, Cedar and Labdanum.\n\nDior launches its new fragrance Sauvage, with the name originating from the fragrance Eau Sauvage from 1966, although the two don’t belong to the same collection. Sauvage is inspired by wild, open spaces; blue sky that covers rocky landscapes, hot under the desert sun.\n\nDior in-house perfumer, François Demachy, signed this creation. The fragrance is announced as radically fresh, raw and noble at the same time. The composition is reportedly prevalent with carefully selected natural ingredients. Fresh top notes of Calabria bergamot encounter ambroxan, obtained from precious ambergris, and its woody trail.\n\nDior Sauvage comes out in September 2015, advertised by actor Johnny Depp. It is available as 60 and 100 ml Eau de Toilette.",

    "description": "J'adore by Dior is a Floral Fruity fragrance for women. J'adore was launched in 1999. The nose behind this fragrance is Calice Becker. Top notes are Pear, Melon, Magnolia, Peach, Mandarin Orange and Bergamot; middle notes are Jasmine, Lily-of-the-Valley, Tuberose, Freesia, Rose, Orchid, Violet and Plum; base notes are Musk, Vanilla, Cedar and Blackberry. This perfume is the winner of award FiFi Award Best National Advertising Campaign / TV 2007.\n\nJ’adore is a modern, glamorous fragrance, which has become incredibly popular, and for that reason developed in number of variants of different concentrations. J’adore is a luminous fragrance. Its opulent, golden scent shimmers on skin like sunbeams. The classic and ambitions of this fragrance reflects in the bottle shaped like Greek amphora. J’adore presents a new conception of Dior feminity, a scent so new and so in line with Dior style at the same time – sweet but balmy, slightly sharp floral with fresh mandarin in the top; jasmine, plum, orchid and rose in the heart; and amaranth, musk and blackberry in the trail. It was created in 1999.",

Top notes are Bergamot, Pink Pepper and elemi; middle notes are Atlas Cedar, Cashmere Wood and Patchouli; base notes are Iso E Super, Haitian Vetiver and White Musk.\n\nDior Homme, a powdery iris and woody scent for men, was introduced in the original version in 2005 and then later came the new 2011 version. The 2020 version of Dior Homme Eau de Toilette is announced with the slogan \"I'm Your Man.\" The 2011 edition remains on the shelves under the name, Dior Homme Original.\n\nThe new Dior Homme is created by Dior in-house perfumer Francois Demachy who wanted to redefine masculine sensuality. The fragrance is intensely woody, warm, and sensual. A virile accord of Atlas cedar and the warmth of cashmere wood are pampered with spicy aromas. \n\n\"This new Dior Homme has an unmistakably virile signature that does not prevent it from developing tender, sensual accents. It basically draws the portrait of a modern man.\" François Demachy, Dior Perfumer-Creator\n\nAccording to the perfumer, this is a fragrance overdosed with carnal woody notes, and it represents a return to the basics: classic and simplicity. It is clear, clean, gentle, and woody but also slightly sweet, and wears like a second skin.\n\nThe new bottle follows the architectural design of its predecessors, with a more prominent logo and perfume name on the plug. The face of the advertising campaign remains actor Robert Pattinson.\n\nDior Homme is available as a 50 and 100 ml Eau de Toilette with the accompanying grooming line, now available in new packaging.",

Top notes are Pear, Pink Pepper and Orange Blossom; middle notes are Coffee, Jasmine, Bitter Almond and Licorice; base notes are Vanilla, Patchouli, Cashmere Wood and Cedar.\n\nIn September of 2014 Yves Saint Laurent launches Black Opium, the new fragrance announced as a rock'n'roll interpretation of the classic that should highlight the dark, mysterious side of the YSL brand.

Notes of coffee, present in large quantities, dominate the scent. Additional accords are pink pepper, orange blossom, jasmine, vanilla, patchouli and cedar.\n\nThe perfume comes in the bottle designed as the last editions of the Opium collection. The bottle is dark and decorated with sequins that give a glam rock look.\n\nThe face of the perfume's campaign is British model Edie Campbell, shot by Daniel Wolfe.

    "description": "Mon Paris by Yves Saint Laurent is a Chypre Fruity fragrance for women. Mon Paris was launched in 2016. Mon Paris was created by Olivier Cresp, Harry Fremont and Dora Baghriche. Top notes are Strawberry, Raspberry, Pear, Orange, Calabrian bergamot, Tangerine and Calone; middle notes are Peony, Jasmine Sambac, Chinese Jasmine, Datura and Orange Blossom; base notes are Indonesian Patchouli Leaf, Patchouli, White Musk, Vanila, Ambroxan, Moss and Cedar.\n\nYSL is launching the new Paris-inspired line called Mon Paris, coming out mid-2016. Mon Paris is announced as a dazzling fragrance that represents a modern olfactory interpretation of love, free from all the obstacles, dedicated and intense.\n\nThe composition has a fruity start, intoxicating floral heart and a dark chypre base. It opens with a juicy and sweet blend of Calabria bergamot, strawberry, raspberry and pear. The heart is dominated by datura flower accompanied by a bouquet of peony, Chinese and Sambac jasmine and orange blossom. Airy crystal white musk (three types of it), ambroxan and an intense patchouli duo (from Indonesian and Guatemala) provide the provocative classic chypre signature base.\n\nThe campaign shot by French film direction duo Clément Durou and Pierre Dupaquier features Canadian model Crista Cober and French actor Jérémie Laheurte shown together in various parts of Paris, including a club, the Metro, near the Eiffel Tower and on the Opéra Garnier’s roof, during both day and night. The still ad was photographed by Billy Kidd.\n\nYSL Mon Paris is available as a 30, 50 and 90 ml Eau de Parfum.",

    "description": "Gucci Bloom by Gucci is a Floral fragrance for women. Gucci Bloom was launched in 2017. The nose behind this fragrance is Alberto Morillas. Top note is Jasmine; middle note is Tuberose; base note is Rangoon Creeper.\n\nGucci Bloom: Debuting the First Fragrance by Alessandro Michele: “I wanted a green fragrance, a courageous scent that transports you to a vastgarden filled with many flowers and plants, a bouquet of abundance. The garden is as beautiful as women are; colorful, wild, diverse, where there is everything. GucciBloom smells of this garden in order to travel to a place that is not there,” Alessandro Michele.\n\nFlowering from the authentic spirit of the women Alessandro Michele champions is an attitude of freedom to be who you want to be. Mixed with the color, decoration and pattern of the creative director’s design canon, the women he dresses are flourishing in a natural, expressive and individual way: they are in bloom.\n\nThe first Gucci fragrance developed wholly under Alessandro Michele’s creative vision encapsulates this modern philosophy that is the guiding vision for the House.\nGucci Bloom celebrates the authenticity, vitality and diversity of the women he designs for, and those that identify themselves in his vision.\n\nTrue to who they are, these young women experience life and its fruits, blooming into their real selves. They convey their personal point-of-view without conventional limitations. They live for memorable experiences, to create stories and connect and be inspired by the objects, culture and art they choose to be surrounded by. Architect of every element of the scent, Alessandro Michele has infused Gucci Bloom’s idea of lushness, life and vigor in each fragrant note, the dreamy campaign and its unconventional design.\n \nABOUT THE SCENT:  Blended by master perfumer Alberto Morillas with direction from Alessandro Michele, the fragrance is created to unfold like its name. The creative director envisioned the scent as a thriving garden full of diverse types of flowers and the rich perfume it emits.\n \nAuthenticity is woven through qualitative, highly-concentrated natural ingredients.\nNotes blossom out like a concentration of flowers, the unique expression of the new to the world ingredients, brings a new olfactory experience. Natural Tuberose absolute harvested from India is interlaced with natural Jasmine absolute. Jasmine bud extract, obtained through an exclusive method of co-extraction that blends a natural quality of jasmine and captive moleculesto impart a fresh green and petal scent on the skin. Gucci Bloom also features notes of another plant used in perfume-making for the first time, the Rangoon Creeper. Discovered in South India, the Rangoon Creeper embodies the new scent’s concept and name, as it changes color from white, gradually darkens to pink then finally to red when it blooms. The vine’s flowers are redolent with a slightly powdery feminine floral perfume.\n\nABOUT THE DESIGN:  An arbiter and seeker of beauty, Alessandro Michele ideated a flacon and packaging that encapsulates the fragrance’s spirit dedicated to the diversity of women.\n \n“The bottle is not designed feminine to seduce men, but to keep company with the women who wear the perfume. Retro and tender because of its color, with clean, slender lines, and not crafted in transparent glass but in porcelain, a material that I love very much,” he said.\n \nA vintage powder pink shades the lacquered porcelain square-shaped bottle, appliquéd with the Gucci label ribbed and framed in black. The outer carton is covered inside and outside in Herbarium, a red-and-white toile de Jouy House print of leaves, cherry branches and flowers framed in black.\n \n\nABOUT CAMPAIGN:  Encapsulating the very meaning of Gucci Bloom, the campaign’s idea is revealed through the contemporary women of Gucci: actress Dakota Johnson, actress and model Hari Nef and artist Petra Collins. Friends of Alessandro Michele, they have a special connection with the House, their talent resonating with Gucci’s new vision. Their diverse individual beauty is shot by Glen Luchford, allowing them to radiate in the campaign’s transformative setting. They wear Gucci Bloom during their day in the city, and it changes the surrounding urbanity into an imaginary stroll in a fantastical English garden. Tea on a sidewalk flourishing with blooms, walking in an apartment overgrown with verdant plants, and swimming at dusk in a lake entangled with shimmering flowers and reeds.     \n \nDancing, strolling, rejoicing in being free and full of life: this trio embody Gucci’s new vitality and the captivating, transporting nature of Gucci Bloom.\n \n\nThe fragrance will be available as a 30, 50 and 100 ml Eau de Parfum.",

    "description": "Mémoire d’une Odeur by Gucci is a fragrance for women and men. Mémoire d’une Odeur was launched in 2019. The nose behind this fragrance is Alberto Morillas. Top notes are Chamomile and Bitter Almond; middle notes are Musk, Indian Jasmine and Jasmine; base notes are Sandalwood, Cedar and Vanilla.\n\n“Everything comes from my obsession with scents: my memory is primarily olfactive so, for me, my sense of smell is my memory. I thought that, deep down, perfume is that thing that even with your eyes closed, brings you to a precise moment in space and time. When we began to work on Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur, I tried to imagine the recollection of a scent that couldn’t easily be identified; a hybrid scent that resembles memory as much as possible,” Alessandro Michele.\n\nScent is in our subconscious, attached to fragments of moments lived, coloring them with emotions of all-consuming joy, of intense love, or overwhelming sadness. A scent can gift a moment again, so an experience from the past can be relived in the now.\n\nFor a new Gucci fragrance story, scent becomes an explorer of the power of memories, bringing them back from the past and making them live in our present. Skipping backward and forward in chronological time, the present and past are connected by a unique bridge that projects directly into the future. Presenting a new universal Gucci scent. A perfume unassigned with a gender or a time. Presenting Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur.\n\nGucci Mémoire d’une Odeur is an elixir that transcends gender by its individuality, to establish a new olfactive family, Mineral Aromatic. The transcendent accord features unexpected and enigmatic ingredients, and is defined by a note of Roman chamomile. Alessandro Michele envisioned this particular flower inside the scent, blended by master perfumer Alberto Morillas.\n\nGucci Mémoire d’une Odeur’s Roman chamomile is structured with Indian Coral Jasmine petals for tenderness, precious musks for depth, and noble woods including warm, luminous sandalwood and airy, subtle cedarwood, a powerful tree with deep roots and an irresistible vanilla note.\n\nDisrupting the traditional olfactive families that classifies fragrances, Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur establishes a new modern fragrance category, Mineral, which is a mix of scents and emotions: airy, musky, transparent and authentic. Mineral was classically used to describe facets of some fragrances, and combined with Aromatic, it becomes the center of Gucci Memoire d’une Odeur.\n\n”The musky mineral accord is the keystone of the fragrance: it links all the other olfactive elements together with pure softness,” Alberto Morillas.\n\n“I had to think quite carefully about why Alessandro chose chamomile. When I started to work with the scent of chamomile itself, then I understood,” Morillas said. “No one had done it before. Chamomile is known all over the world. Everyone has smelt it at some point, but as a dream, a memory of childhood, something timeless, and never in a fragrance. This flower is much underestimated and is a plant with an exceptional olfactive signature.”\n\nRoman Chamomile has grown around Rome in terraced gardens since the 16th and 17th centuries. Giving a green aromatic scent, the sunny and hardy flower has an unparalleled character, radiating with joy to a sweet aromatic dry down with honey and green apple.\nIndian Coral Jasmine Nature Print ® : A note exclusive to Gucci, collected in India, the star-shaped flower emits a more powerful scent and colors at night, remaining lighter and fresher during the day. Referred to as Queen of the Night, the official flower of Bengal, this unique quality of jasmine has a honeyed temper and an orangey coral-colored heart.\n\nGucci Mémoire d’une Odeur’s dry down is an evanescent cloud, evolving on skin with a rhythm of Musks and iconic woods: Cedarwood and Sandalwood. The woody architecture of the fragrance brings intensity to its structure.\n\nAlessandro Michele discovered a vintage Gucci fragrance bottle, and was inspired by its design for Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur’s bottle. Grooved like a column from an ancient world, the bottle casts a refined silhouette in heavy transparent light green glass, crowned with shiny gold cap. Printed gold foil frames the label, revealing the Gucci logo together with the name of the fragrance.\n\n“The packaging comes from the past, inspired by an old Gucci perfume from the early 90s. I didn’t want the bottle to take on a shape or size that is too feminine or too masculine because the perfume could be very much for women or very much for men,” Alessandro Michele.\n\nSymbolizing a starry night sky and the earthly world that gazes up at it in marvel, the perfume’s green box is decorated with Celestial firmaments inspired by the paintings of Roman and gothic churches of the Middle Ages and Renaissance in Europe. This particular pattern recalls Giotto’s frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padova.\n\n“The guiding element of the entire campaign is the idea of freedom; the idea of the non-era, the non-place, the non-social. I pictured a world that was a fresco of a ‘mythological’ life in which the family is a private community with its own social framework where total freedom of expression prevails and where the roles of people and things aren’t clear. I pictured the memory of an authentic memory,” Alessandro Michele.\n\nA gathering of a free-spirited family, who embrace life by living freely and making memories together, an idea by Alessandro Michele. In diverse settings on the outskirts of Rome, the family are captured dancing, picnicking at sun kissed ruins of Canale Monterano, and in and around their family home, Montecalvello Castle—a medieval castle featuring a fountain in a courtyard, and enigmatic frescoes inside and out. Director of the campaign Glen Luchford imbues the video and images with vibrant nostalgia, under the artistic direction of Christopher Simmonds. The print advertising campaign is composed like intimate photo albums, that show each member’s character and their intimate rapport with one another.\n\nSinger, songwriter and actor Harry Styles leads the cast of the family, which includes an eclectic and universal mix of talents and models: Zumi Rosow (designer and musician), Ariana Papademetropoulos (artist), Stanislas Klossowski de Rola (actor and musician), Olimpia Dior (artist), Leslie Winer (model and musician), Thomas Riguelle (model), Tex Santos-Shaw (model), Tessa Bruinsma (model), Olga Zapivokhina (model), Oleg Ulrich (model), Matïss Rucko (model), Mae Lapres (model), William Valente (model), Katea Gramma (model), Unia Pakhomova (model), Ellia Sophia (model), Elibeidy Dani Martinez (model), Cheikh Tall (model), and Aaron Sirainen (model).\n\nThe fragrance is available from August 1st 2019 as a 40m, 60ml and 100ml Eau de Parfum, and as a 30ml rollerball bottle.",

Top notes are Pear and Red Berries; middle notes are Gardenia and Frangipani; base note is Patchouli.\n\nThe prestigious Italian fashion house of Gucci launches a new collection of fragrances under the creative director of Frida Giannini. It comes out in May 2012 named Flora by Gucci Garden Collection. The collection includes five most important blossoms outlined on the legendary Gucci scarf designed by Vittorio Accornero for Princess Grace of Monaco. These five new editions are: Glorious Mandarin, Gracious Tuberose, Gorgeous Gardenia, Glamorous Magnolia and Generous Violet.\n\n“It’s a sort of bouquet of scents,” said Giannini for wwd, “So Gorgeous Gardenia because I wanted to underline the gorgeously feminine side of this fragrance. Glorious Mandarin because there’s a sort of euphoria in mandarin, since it’s such a sparkly fruit.”\n\nIn the process of making these fragrances, it was very important to distinguish them from one another. The idea is that each fragrance should reflect a facet of the same woman. The fragrances come in elongated hexagonal shaped bottles with transparent rather than gold stoppers.\n\nThe face of the advertising campaign is Abbey Lee Kershaw, shot by Solve Sundsbø. The fragrances are available as 50 and 100 ml Eau de Toilette, except mandarin and violet one that will be available exclusively at Gucci flag stores as 100 ml Eau de Toilette.",

    "description": "Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum by Gucci is a Floral fragrance for women. Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum was launched in 2010. Top notes are Peony, Citruses and Mandarin Orange; middle notes are Osmanthus and Rose; base notes are Sandalwood and Patchouli.\n\nThe new edition,Flora by Gucci EDP, can be expected on the market at the beginning of 2010. This version was announced as more intense, deeper, seductive and richer. Notes of Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum promise the same youthful and optimistic expression of the composition as it was offered by EDT. The difference lies in stronger concentration of the EDP edition. Flora by Gucci was envisaged and created by Frida Giannini who was inspired by Gucci floral pattern used first as a scarf for Grace, Princess of Monaco. Floral motive has been enchanting women with glamorous and feminine details for decades.\n\nFlora by Gucci Eau de Parfum is characterized by fresh notes of agrums in the opening, combined with beautiful peony. A heart introduces balanced aromas of rose and osmanthus, while a base is created of patchouli and sandalwood. The more opulent, stronger and more powerful EDP has the same flacon as the original edition, but is decorated with gold details on a black bow ribbon, black cap and darker liquid. The fragrance arrives in January 2010.",

Sicilian mandarin, mint, cypress and clary sage are in charge of cold, herbal refreshment. Tart not of the fragrance is provided by a fine dose of black pepper, and woody masculine accords consist of cedar and sandalwood from New Caledonia, shaped and softened by sensual musk and warm tonka beans. This extreme composition is reflected in a combination of freshness, tartness, sensuality, sharpness and strength!\n\nFlacon of the new edition has the same shape as previous Chanel Allure Homme edition in dark color with a silver color ring on the stopper with engraved name of the brand. Red and white letters on dark body of the flacon provide dynamics to the edition. The fragrance is available as 50 and 100ml Eau Extreme.\n\nFace of the advertising campaign is professional surfer Danny Fully, while advertising video clips were directed (Chanel presented them in several versions of advertising clips) by Oscar winner Kathryn Bigalow.",

Top notes are Orange, Sea Notes, Aldehydes and Blood Mandarin; middle notes are Pepper, Neroli and Cedar; base notes are Vanilla, Tonka Bean, White Musk, Amber, Vetiver and Elemi resin.\n\nFive years after the launch of Allure Homme, Chanel house presented Allure Homme Sport, which came as a fresher and sharper fragrance. The crystal clear beginning introduces notes of water and aldehydes. It is followed by woodsy and spicy character of the fragrance, which thanks to luminous vetiver is not oriental heavy, but light and translucent. The base is composed of sensual white musk, tonka beans and amber. It was designed in 2004 by the famous \\'nose\\' of Chanel house, Jacques Polge.",

    "description": "Coco Noir by Chanel is a Oriental Woody fragrance for women. Coco Noir was launched in 2012. Coco Noir was created by Jacques Polge and Christopher Sheldrake. Top notes are Grapefruit, Bergamot and Orange; middle notes are Rose, Geranium, Jasmine, Narcissus and Peach; base notes are Patchouli, Sandalwood, Olibanum, Tonka Bean, Vanille, White Musk, Cloves and Benzoin.\n\nCoco Noir ilaunches in September 2012.\n\n\"For Coco Noir, I thought of Coco and of Coco Mademoiselle too, because it’s also part of the history. I wanted to continue exploring an entire esthetic range of CHANEL perfumery, a range that distinguishes itself from the Florals, one that is illustrated by Bois-des-Iles and Cuir de Russie. I took it up with Coco. It’s what I like to call the CHANEL Coromandel culture, what you see and feel in her apartment. The night vision of the ‘Orient that starts and ends in Venice’ imposed itself upon me and that is where I wanted to go.” perfumer Jacques Polge.\n\nIn 1984, there was Coco, that sumptuous blend of wood, resins, flowers, spices and fruit. A treasure trove of splendours and an endless source of discovery and sensual delight. Then, in 2001, came Coco Mademoiselle, a breath of air that lightens this cornucopia of fragrance, in which everything is simplified and accelerated in a radiant burst of fruit and flower. And today there is Coco Noir, a great nocturnal Baroque. Another journey in the wake of a Gabrielle who fully embraced the dazzle of black and Venice, incorporating them not only into her creations but into her life.\n\nTop notes: grapefruit, Calabrian bergamot, Heart: rose, narcissus, rose geranium leaf and jasmine. Base: tonka bean, sandalwood, vanilla, patchouli and white musk frankincense.",

    "description": "Chance Eau de Toilette by Chanel is a Chypre Floral fragrance for women. Chance Eau de Toilette was launched in 2002. The nose behind this fragrance is Jacques Polge. Top notes are Patchouli, Pink Pepper, Pineapple, Hiacynth and Iris; middle notes are Lemon, Jasmine and Rose; base notes are Patchouli, Musk, Vetiver and Vanilla.\n\nChance in French means \\'luck\\'. Chanel and Chance sound so similar as if they were created for each other. Chance is the only Chanel perfume in round bottle as opposed to the classical plane Chanel N°5 rectangle bottle. It is not accidental, though, as it is a \\'wheel of fortune\\'. A wave of extreme freshness meets with the flowery notes and continues with sensual spicy composition. \\'Chance is a tornado… the door open to adventure and unknown, just like lips ready for a kiss.\\'\n\nThere are pink pepper, lemon and pine apple in the top notes. The heart encompasses hyacinth, jasmine and iris, while the base is composed of amber, patchouli, vetiver and white musk. The perfume was created by Jacques Polge in 2002.",

    "description": "Acqua di Gioia by Giorgio Armani is a Floral Aquatic fragrance for women. Acqua di Gioia was launched in 2010. Acqua di Gioia was created by Loc Dong, Anne Flipo and Dominique Ropion. Top notes are Amalfi Lemon and Mint; middle note is Water Jasmine; base notes are Virginia Cedar, Brown sugar and French labdanum.\n\nAcqua di Gioia is a new fragrance by Giorgio Armani, presented in March 2010. Seductive sea aromas in the new fragrance are put into first plan and used as creators' inspiration. Composition of the perfume is compared with woman who is ''strong, dignified and free spirit but in perfect harmony with nature''.\n\nInspired by several summer holidays spent on the islands of Pantelleria and Antigua, where Armani has his villas, the fragrance was lead by the idea of escape into nature, a heavenly place of real holiday where we restore the energy necessary to body and soul, and where we create natural balance.\n\nIts flacon was made as a natural shape – water drops which are clear, airy, and pellucid.\n\nThe fragrance arrives on the market in June 2010 as a blend of refreshing notes of crushed mint leaves and lemon Limone Primo Fiore Femminello from Calabria. Structure of the composition pushes the limits from fresh citruses to a floral heart which encompasses aquatic jasmine, dewy peony and pink pepper, while a base closes with cedar, yellow sugar and labdanum. Acqua di Gioia was created by three perfumers: Loc Dong, Anne Flipo and Dominique Ropion, who see it as Eve's seduction and as fragrance turned completely towards the nature.\n\nThe perfume can be purchased as 30, 50 and 100 ml EDP, along with 200 ml body lotion.",

ARMANI CODE PARFUM, the new powerful yet sensitive olfactory signature.\"\n\nTop notes: bergamot, bergamot leaf\nHeart: orris butter, iris aldehyde, clary sage\nBase: tonka bean, cedar \n\n\"Crafted as a statement bottle with a unique, rounded-square shape, the new ARMANI CODE bottle reimagines the design of the original fragrance. This newly conceived bottle is refillable, demonstrating Giorgio Armani’s mindfulness of the planet. In its sleek, striking black form, elevated with sensorial touches and silver accents, the bottle stands as a beautiful object, designed to last.\"",

    "description": "Sì Passione by Giorgio Armani is a Floral Fruity fragrance for women. Sì Passione was launched in 2017. Sì Passione was created by Christine Nagel and Julie Massé. Top notes are Pear, Black Currant, Pink Pepper and Grapefruit; middle notes are Pineapple, Rose, Jasmine and Heliotrope; base notes are Vanilla, Cedar, Patchouli and Amberwood.\n\nIn December 2017, Armani launches a new edition of Sì fragrance from 2013, represented by Hollywood actress Cate Blanchett. Sì Passione is a reinterpretation of the original that gives it a new dimension - described as \"an irresistible combination of grace, strength and independent spirit.\" Announced as an intense, uncompromising scent, it is made for a confident woman who dares to say yes, and is to embody the red lipstick effect in the bottle.\n\n\"Sì Passione is a bright and sensual perfume that emits confidence, seduction, and strength. Bright and fresh in its initial impression, Sì Passione opens with notes of spicy pink pepper, like a burst of adrenaline. After initially drawing attention, sparkling and radiant pear brightens the iconic juicy blackcurrant to add boldness. A floral heart beats passionately with rose and feminine jasmine to create a powerful scent, like a seemingly fragile woman who shows incredible strength when guided by passion. The addition of heliotrope makes this perfume addictive and acts as an invitation to self-indulgence and pleasure. The warm and sensual vanilla and cedarwood dry down mirrors the self-assurance that a swipe of red lipstick can instantly give the wearer.\"\n\nThe fragrance is available as a 30, 50 and 100 ml Eau de Parfum.",

    "description": "Eros by Versace is a Aromatic Fougere fragrance for men. Eros was launched in 2012. The nose behind this fragrance is Aurélien Guichard. Top notes are Mint, Green Apple and Lemon; middle notes are Tonka Bean, Ambroxan and Geranium; base notes are Madagascar Vanilla, Virginian Cedar, Atlas Cedar, Vetiver and Oakmoss.\n\nVersace is launching a new fragrance for men – Eros inspired by and deeply connected with Greek mythology. The aim of this edition is to reveal and release unrestrained passion and to accentuate desire. The fragrance was named after Greek god of love and son of goddess Aphrodite – Eros. Inspiration by ancient Greece has lasted since the time when Gianni Versace raised his fashion empire and took goddess Medusa as symbol of the brand to adorn numerous products of the house, among them also the new flacon of men's fragrance Eros.\n\nThe new perfume Eros is the first in the past five years to be launched and aimed at men. Donatella Versace's desire was to fit the fragrance into the concept of the Versace brand and to depict style and significance of long-lasting design, quality and popularity. \"Eros is truly the DNA of the house of Versace\" - explains Donatella. \"We have a Greek motive making us think about ancient Greece, antiquities and mythology, while turquoise color represents the Mediterranean. That is Versace!\"\n\nEros was created by Aurelien Guichard of Givaudan and it was announced as fresh, woody and slightly oriental. The fragrance includes mint oil combined with green apple and Italian lemon. Warmth is provided by tonka mixed with Venezuelan ambroxan and geranium flowers giving a fougere twist to the fragrance this way.\n\nFlacon of the new fragrance for men Eros is created of turquoise color glass with head of Medusa on the body of the bottle and on its top. The fragrance is available as 50 and 100 ml EDT, along with accompanying perfumed body care products. Face of the advertising campaign is Brian Shimansky, while photographers are Mert & Marcus. Donatella wanted a man-gladiator for the new campaign, who is fighting for what he wants, fighting for his goals. \"This is a fragrance for a man who is his own master. He is a hero: a man who defends their ideas and goals.\" - stated Donatella Versace.",

    "description": "Eros Flame by Versace is a Woody Spicy fragrance for men. Eros Flame was launched in 2018. The nose behind this fragrance is Olivier Pescheux. Top notes are Mandarin Orange, Madagascar Pepper, Lemon, Chinotto and Rosemary; middle notes are Geranium, Rose and Pepperwood™; base notes are Vanilla, Tonka Bean, Sandalwood, Texas Cedar, Patchouli and Oakmoss.\n\nVersace Eros Flame, is a flanker to the original masculine Eros from 2012. While the pillar is an aromatic-fougère, the new scent goes into a totally different direction with citrusy, spicy, woody, and ambery accords, described as \"cold and hot, sweet and spicy, light and shadow.\"\n\nThe concept is based on an interpretation of passionate love, marketed as a fragrance for a \"strong, passionate, self-confident man who is deeply in touch with his emotions.\"\n\nOlivier Pescheux developed the composition as one of contrasts; the head notes are made to be vivacious and fresh with italian citruses, black pepper and rosemary. Pepperwood, geranium and rose facets are in the heart, before a warm base of woods, blended with tonka and vanilla.\n\nThe advertising campaign is a modern interpretation of Canova's iconic \"Eros and Psyche\" sculpture, where a man embraces a woman played by Gigi Hadid and Salomon Diaz. The campaign is shot by Steven Meisel.\n\nVersace Eros Flame is available as a 30, 50, 100 and 200 ml Eau de Parfum, a 100 ml After Shave Lotion, a 100 ml After Shave Balm, a 75 ml Deodorant Stick, a 100 ml Deodorant and a 250 ml Shower Gel.",

    "description": "Versense by Versace is a Woody Floral Musk fragrance for women. Versense was launched in 2009. Top notes are Bergamot, Citruses, Green Mandarin, Fig and Pear; middle notes are Cardamom, Lily, Jasmine and Narcissus; base notes are Virginia Cedar, Musk, Olive Tree and Sandalwood.\n\nThis modern fragrance of a beautiful and rare floral bouquet is composed of elements of the Mediterranean and it represents Versace woman perfectly with its authentic expression and a fusion of freshness and energy. The new fragrance by the house of Versace was named Versace Versense and it promises a lot with its name and composition. It is created for irresistible experience for all senses.\n\nThe fragrance Versace Versense is composed of natural tones and it is a picture of awakening of nature, evoking feeling of freedom, movement and balance of internal energy with surroundings and nature. Versense is a walk in a fragrant garden, which contributes to freshness and a stream of feelings, as well as to self-esteem and vitality.\n\nIts composition opens with fruit of the Mediterranean: bergamot and green mandarin, and wraps you with freshness and luminous, optimistic accords with irresistible fig zests. Pleasure will rise with sparks of citruses mixed with fruity aromas. They will take us to a heart ruled by sea lily, rare flower with rare aromas, strengthened with jasmine petals and bitter-spicy accords of cardamom in an elegant way. Base notes leave a cover of woody accords of sandalwood, cedar, olive wood and sensual musk.\n\nFlacon of this perfume is made of see-through glass, created just like its antecedent from 2008, Versace. It is coloured in light green, it is luxurious and decorated with traditional Versace symbols. The new eau de toilette is accompanied with a 200 ml perfumed bath, 200 ml perfumed body milk and 75 ml deo spray. EDT Versace Versense is available in amounts of 30, 50 and 100ml (1, 1.7 and 3 oz) edt. Advertising face for Versense is Toni Garrn, and photographer is Michelangelo di Battista.",

    "description": "Yellow Diamond by Versace is a Floral fragrance for women. Yellow Diamond was launched in 2011. Top notes are Amalfi Lemon, Pear, Bergamot and Neroli; middle notes are Mimosa, Freesia, Water Lily and African Orange Flower; base notes are Musk, Guaiac Wood and Amber.\n\nVersace started its glamorous fragrance line inspired by crystals in 2004 with Crystal Noir perfume, and then launched the lighter and fruitier Bright Crystal in 2006. In 2011, a new fragrance of the collection emerges, \"a crystal that turns into a diamond,\" named Yellow Diamond.\n\nYellow Diamond is crafted as a pure, transparent and airy floral fragrance, sparkling and intense as the yellow color, while being luxurious and feminine like a diamond. Its composition opens with luminous freshness of lemon, bergamot, neroli and pear sorbet. The heart features airy orange blossom, freesia, mimosa and water lily. The base is made of amber, precious musk and guaiac wood.\n\nThe bottle is shaped like the previous editions of the collection, colored in yellow, while its box is decorated with baroque ornaments. The face of the campaign is an Australian model Abbey Lee Kershaw, shot by Mario Testino in Paris.\n\nVersace Yellow Diamond is available as 50 and 90 ml Eau de Toilette, with deodorant and body lotion.",

Top notes are Cardamom, Nutmeg, Saffron, Mandarin Orange and Neroli; middle notes are Kulfi, Rose, Mastic or Lentisque, Orange Blossom and Jasmine; base notes are Vanilla, Amber, Woody Notes and Sandalwood.\n\nTom Ford launched Tom Ford Noir Eau de Parfum in 2012, followed by Tom Ford Noir Eau de Toilette in November 2013. In May 2015, he prepared a new version of the fragrance called Tom Ford Noir Extreme.\n\n“Tom Ford Noir Extreme reveals a new dimension of the Noir man. An amber drenched, woody oriental fragrance with a tantalizing and delectable heart, Noir Extreme captures the aspect of the man that relishes in immoderation and dares to be extraordinary. \"\n\nThe composition opens with a blend of fresh citruses and warm spicy notes. There are mandarin oil, neroli, saffron, cardamom and nutmeg at the beginning. Its heart contains accord of Indian kulfi dessert, traditionally made of Himalayan snow and pistachio, transmitted with mastic accord. A bouquet of rose absolute, jasmine and orange blossom is also placed in the heart. Hot amber in the base is subtly balanced with woody accords of sandalwood and milky- sweet vanilla.\n\nThe face of the campaign is Tom Ford himself. Available as 50 and 100 Eau de Parfum.",

    "description": "Velvet Orchid by Tom Ford is a Oriental Floral fragrance for women. Velvet Orchid was launched in 2014. Velvet Orchid was created by Yann Vasnier, Calice Becker, Shyamala Maisondieu and Antoine Maisondieu. Top notes are Rum, Honey, Mandarin Orange and Bergamot; middle notes are Black Orchid, Orchid, Jasmine, Heliotrope, Hyacinth, Rose Oil, Narcissus, Magnolia and Orange Blossom; base notes are Vanilla, Myrrh, Suede, Sandalwood, Peru Balsam and Labdanum.\n\nThe new feminine perfume creation from designer Tom Ford is called Velvet Orchid as an association of the most popular vamp fragrance of this house Black Orchid that was launched in 2006. The new version Velvet Orchid comes out in 2014 and carries on the legacy of bold and glamorous floral signature that promises a unique character, atmosphere and experience of the scent.\n\nThe fragrance opens itself with bergamot, mandarin, Succan absolute (purified rum extract) and honey. At the core of this creation (made of \"corporeal floral notes.\") is Tom Ford's distinctive, “timeless” signature - an imaginary accord of black orchid blended with notes of velvet orchid, which gives the perfume its name, with intense Turkish rose oil and jasmine and a new accord of purple orchid that grows in the wilds of southern Brazilian coast. There are also additional floral notes of orange blossom, rose absolute, narcissus, hyacinth and heliotrope. The base is warm due to the rich flavors of Peru balsam, myrrh, labdanum, sandalwood, suede and vanilla.\n\nThis new luxurious perfume is available in dim purple bottles of classic Tom Ford designs in 50 and 100 ml Eau de Parfum concentration.",

    "description": "Goddess by Burberry is a Aromatic fragrance for women. Goddess was launched in 2023. The nose behind this fragrance is Amandine Clerc-Marie. Top notes are Vanilla, Lavender, Cacao and Ginger; middle note is Vanilla Caviar; base note is Vanilla Absolute.\n\n“Fragrance has always been a great love of mine, and I am fascinated with the power that scent can have and the way it can immediately transport you to a specific time and place in your life. Being allowed to become an ambassador for the new Burberry fragrance feels particularly special and personal.\n\nTo me, lionesses represent female unity and strength. They are confident and move together. Much like them, we stand on the shoulders of the women who came before us and those who bolster us throughout our own lives. To me, this image is a real source of empowerment.” - Emma Mackey, Burberry Beauty Ambassador\n\nBurberry unveils the new Burberry Goddess Eau de Parfum, a unique aromatic fragrance for women. The launch is supported by a campaign featuring British-French actress and new ambassador for Burberry Beauty, Emma Mackey.\n\nThe campaign presents a story of self-discovery inspired by the collective strength and power of the pride of lionesses. Created with live footage of lionesses in their natural environment and the latest CGI technology, Burberry creates an imaginary world where Emma Mackey and the pride come together as one.\n\nEmbodying the spirit of the Burberry Goddess Eau de Parfum, Emma channels the strength of the pride, igniting the power within to discover her inner confidence and ascend the peak ahead of her. Echoing Shygirl in the overlaid vocals, ‘one of me, but I’m not the only one, we are many burning like the sun’, the lionesses represent the collective power of female strength and support and the fact that together, we can all discover our inner goddess and achieve the extraordinary.\n\nA unique gourmand aromatic fragrance led by a powerful trio of distinct vanillas. Collected by hand, the beans dry in the sun for five to seven weeks. They are then stored in wooden boxes to mature and develop their sweet signature aroma.\n\n“My initial goal for Burberry Goddess was to expand upon the common use of vanilla to deliver a new kind of rich olfactive experience. For this purpose, I used three distinct types of vanilla extraction. The first is a vanilla infusion, which provides the brightest, woody vanilla possible. Then I used Firgood™ , also known as vanilla caviar, for the first time in a fragrance. This innovative new ingredient adds a sweet, rich, and animalic vanilla. Lastly, vanilla absolute is darker and richer, enhancing the fragrance with a mysterious, milky aspect.\"  - Amandine Clerc-Marie, Master Perfumer.\n\nDuring the process of creating the perfect vanilla accord, the precious vanilla was wrapped with notes of bright Lavender Diva essence from Provence and earthy notes of cocoa and ginger roots, creating an aromatic balance to each vanilla.\n\nOlfactive Pyramid\n\nTop: Vanilla Infusion and Lavender\n\nHeart: Vanilla Caviar\n\nBase: Vanilla Absolute\n\nFamily: Gourmand Aromatic\n \n\nMarking Burberry’s first-ever refillable fragrance, the bottle boasts an elegant design. The gabardine-inspired gold label on the outer casing references Burberry’s long-standing heritage, whilst the archive-inspired bottle is modernized with a gold medallion.\n\nBurberry Goddess is available\nin 10 ml, 30 ml, 50 ml, and 100 ml bottles.\n\nBurberry Goddess Shower Gel,\nBody Lotion and Refill (150ml) complete the collection.",

    "description": "My Burberry by Burberry is a Floral fragrance for women. My Burberry was launched in 2014. The nose behind this fragrance is Francis Kurkdjian. Top notes are Sweet Pea, Bergamot, Mandarin Orange, Grapefruit and Lemon; middle notes are Quince, Freesia, Geranium, Peach, Green Notes, Gardenia and Passionfruit; base notes are Damask Rose, Rose, Patchouli, Musk, Leather and Violet.\n\nA new Burberry fragrance expected on the market in September 2014 will be named MY BURBERRY, and it is inspired by the cult trench coat of the Burberry brand and a London garden after rain. It is announced as a very floral fragrance whose task is to enter the top 10 in the luxury arena of beauty! High aims of the Burberry brand are supported by the announcement that this will be one of the key editions in the fragrance collection of the house, but also that the largest collection on the occasion of a perfume launch so far is being prepared.\n\nBritish charm is captured by the camera of Mario Testino who will take photos of Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne with the aim to transfer the British style of fragrance and to present the women it was aimed at.\n\nBesides the challenge to convey the cult style of the Burberry trench coat, the freshness of a London shower and the scent of a rain-bathed garden, the wish of the Burberry brand head was to show skills in creation, tradition and creativity. Simona Cattaneo, senior vice-president of Burberry Beauty sector said the following: \"Burberry trench is something very personal. You can wear it in several different ways, in different places and occasions. There is an emotional connection with trench, and we wanted to transfer it to the new fragrance,\" adding that the new fragrance is composed of a floral bouquet with a modern twist and a pepper accent.\n\nThe composition of the new fragrance My Burberry opens with sweet peas and citrusy notes of bergamot leading to geranium, freesia flowers and golden quince in the heart. The fragrance is rounded up with patchouli in the base, joined with Damascus and Centifolia rose! The perfumer of the composition My Burberry is Francis Kurkdjian!\n\nKurkdjian said the fragrance was inspired “by London, an urban garden. You have the vibrancy of the city, so it is something contemporary. You have the garden. You have the flowers…and the art of gardening, which is very important for the British. The flowery aspect of the perfume comes from that idea of the garden after the rain. You have the lush wetness. You have the soil. You have the earthiness. All of these feelings.” As for his choice of notes, he said he wanted to evoke “the feeling of the light of London: clouds, wetness, rain, flowers.” He said the main flowers are roses and freesia, “which is a little bit spicy and adds brightness. Then geranium leaves, which give an herbal, almost minty, vibrancy to the perfume. Then from the back note, there are patchouli leaves and quince—a fruit that is between a pear and an apple. Very British. It is not fruity, fruity. It is fruity floral. Then on top you have linen and bergamot,” he said.\n\nThe flacon of the new fragrance My Burberry is made of glass, with a stopper inspired by the button of a Burberry trench coat. The color is honey-beige, also taken from the cult trench. The neck of the bottle features a ribbon made of the same fabric as the Burberry trench from a factory in Castleford, Yorkshire. Perfume My Burberry will be available as 30, 50, 90 and 900 ml Eau de Parfum accompanied with perfumed body care products (240 ml shower oil, 100 ml body mist, 100 ml deodorant and 3 soaps set).",

    "description": "Burberry Brit for Men by Burberry is a Oriental Woody fragrance for men. Burberry Brit for Men was launched in 2004. The nose behind this fragrance is Antoine Maisondieu. Top notes are Ginger, Cardamom, Bergamot and Green Mandarin; middle notes are Wild Rose, Nutmeg, Cedar and Spicy Notes; base notes are Tonka Bean, Gray Musk, Cedar, Oriental Woodsy notes and Patchouli. This perfume is the winner of 2 awards: FiFi Award Best National Advertising Campaign / Print 2005 and FiFi Award Fragrance Of The Year Men`s Luxe 2005.\n\nNonchalant Burberry Brit for Men is a perfect illustration of modern English spirit inwrought with tradition. Young English actor Hugh Dancy sitting in front of a fabulous old-timer embodies to perfection the laid-back, elegant spirit and philosophy of this new scent for men; demureness and irony, a classic turned into casual fragrance. Citrusy freshness of mandarin and bergamot and cool, spicy notes of ginger and cardamom preceed a masculine heart of cedar and nutmeg with a touch of refined wild rose. The base is sensual due to precious egzotic woods, gray amber, Tonka bean and patchouli. It was created by Antoine Maisondieu in 2004.",

Baron and Bailey designed the bottle for the Beat and it respresents an enlarged version of Burberry’s checked pattern painted on a scarft, which was worn by Deyn in the commercial. The bottle has a silver-coloured cap, as well as an amulet made of suede and metal, which was an interesting novelty in Burberries decorative/fashion accessories. It is advertised by Agyness Deyn, accompanied by Fabien Baron’s marketing and David Sims’ photography.

Top notes are Pear and Bergamot; middle notes are Tuberose, Orange Blossom and Jasmine Sambac; base notes are Patchouli, Vanilla, Ambroxan and Vetiver.\n\nAmong the first perfume creations of the house of Givenchy stands the legendary scent of L'Interdit from 1957, dedicated to actress Audrey Hepburn as the most significant muse of this fashion designer. \n\nIn 2018, its new, modern version called L'Interdit Givenchy comes out, developed by perfumers Dominique Ropion, Anne Flipo and Fanny Bal as a floral-woody composition. The perfume is built on the basis of contrast between a bouquet of white flowers (including jasmine, tuberose and orange blossom) and intense woody and earthy notes of patchouli and vetiver. The concept behind the creation is the \"thrill of the forbidden\" and the challenge of crossing the line.\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENTS:\n\n\"A white floral exalted with a dark accord. The first resolutely underground flower.\nThe white notes - orange blossom, jasmin and tuberose - are interlaced with darker more mysterious notes of vetiver and patchouli.\nA generous intense brightness that isn’t afraid of subversion.\nUnforgettable, intense, addictive and fearlessly elegant. The shocking side of chic.\"\n\nThe bottle of thick glass pays homage to the original shape with a more modern outline with the 4 G logo added to the black ribbon that encircles the neck. The face of the new L'Interdit release is actress Rooney Mara. Givenchy L'Interdit is available in 35, 50 and 80 ml Eau de Parfum.",

    "description": "Ange ou Demon by Givenchy is a Oriental Floral fragrance for women. Ange ou Demon was launched in 2006. Ange ou Demon was created by Olivier Cresp and Jean-Pierre Bethouart. Top notes are Saffron, Thyme and Mandarin Orange; middle notes are Lily, Ylang-Ylang and Orchid; base notes are Vanilla, Tonka Bean, Brazilian Rosewood and Oakmoss.\n\nThe dualistic nature of Ange ou Demon (\"Angel or Devil\") reveals new feelings, allures with its mystery and versatility, scandalizes and seduces. The strong charismatic oriental composition is innocently crystal and sensual at the same time.\nSweet freshness of the top notes of mandarin, white cumin and saffron opens the way to the opulent floral heart: the strong lily note in alliance with casual notes of Maxillaria orchid and exotic ylang-ylang. The trace is dominated by two woodsy notes: creamy rosewood and dense oak moss absolute, while the powdery and sensual Tonka and vanilla end the composition.\n\nThe fragrance was created by Jean-Pierre Bethouart and Olivier Cresp in 2006. (Please note: in come countries, this fragrance is marketed under the name \"Ange ou Etrange\" [\"Angel or Curious Case\"]).",

The fragrance is a kind of outlook on life, inspired by joy and pleasure in small things.\n\nThis gourmand yet elegant composition is developed by perfumers Olivier Polge, Dominique Ropion and Anne Flipo. The final formula is the result achieved after three years of probation and 5000 versions. Iris is the key ingredient of the perfume, surrounded by orange blossoms and jasmine in the heart. The composition’s opening provides fruity flavors of black currant and pear, while the base is warm, gourmand and powdery due to almond-like accords of tonka bean, praline, patchouli and vanilla.\n\nThe flacon is a redesigned version of the classic Lancome bottle from 1949. Actress Julia Roberts is the face of the campaign, shot by director Tarsem Singh.\n\nIt is available in EDP concentration.",

The beauty lies in living, in maintaining interests, in seeing and cherishing every second of life as a miracle, and in the ability to start all over again. Uma Turman is the face of Miracle – a beautiful and wonderful woman able to walk both on the air and on solid ground.\n\nMiracle is modern, oriental fragrance with fruity opening (litchi); slightly spiced flowery heart (magnolia, jasmine, ginger and pepper); and powdery base of musk and amber.

The composition features intoxicating Himalayan blue poppy, white and yellow flowers (mimosa, rose, freesia...) and vanilla flower.

The bottle with this miraculous bitter honey is a synthesis of the contrasts – attractive curves and straight lines.",

Insolence felt in a heart comes from pink pepper and a dose of gentleness from currant buds. Base notes provide tranquility and comfort– composed of warm and soft vanilla, woody nuances of Virginian cedar and sensual musky veil.\n\nTop notes: raspberry rose absolute\nHeart: jasmine, peony, currant buds, pink pepper\nBase: Virginian cedar, musk and vanilla\n\nFace of the new Lancome Tresor Midnight Rose is Emma Watson, who posed for photos of the campaign in Paris.

It resembles a figure eight; it opens and fully reveals its character while the direction of its development suddenly changes, and it starts to move in the opposite direction, ending where it started. It is one of the most bewitching oriental fragrances. This exotic bouquet starts with Bulgarian rose and blackcurrant buds. At its heart, the jasmine flame burns, blended with ylang-ylang, amber, and incense, among other notes.",

This fragrance, like all of the fragrances of D&G house, is a \\'fragrance with character\\', special and alluring. Its oriental floral-fruity composition is very warm and sensual with powdery vanilla trace. The color of the fragrance perfectly matches its tone.\n\nThe composition opens with softly fresh mandarin, bergamot, litchi and peach. The heart is thin and balmy, with the notes of jasmine, lily of the valley and white lily which graciously intertwine with the fruity touch of plum. The woodsy-powdery base is created of vetiver root, amber, musk and vanilla. The One was created in 2006.",

Top notes are Grapefruit, Coriander and Basil; middle notes are Ginger, Cardamom and Orange Blossom; base notes are Amber, Tobacco and Cedar.\n\nAfter presenting more than successful fragrance for women, The One, Dolce&Gabbana house launched a fragrance for men named The One for Men at the begining of March 2008.\n\nCreating this fragrance, Stefano Gabbana was following the idea of creating an uomo, a very masculine fragrance, and a very classic one, \\\"not a banal classic, but a classic men\\'s fragrance that would last for years and be the type of scent that women adore\\\".\n\nThe notes of this fragrance are composed in accordance with the Gabbana creator\\'s taste, who wanted to create a woody-oriental composition. In line with that Gabbana said:\"I like spicy-oriental notes and we\\'ve never done these types of fragrances, it\\'s a little warmer than our other men's scents\".\n\nFragrance The One for Men opens with sparkling notes of bergamot, coriander and basil, the middle motes bring in cardamom, ginger and neroli, while the base notes create a very masculine trace of cedar, ambergris and tobacco.\n\nThe fragrance is created in cooperation with P&G Prestige Product and International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF). It comes in a glass made bottle that matches the shape of The One for Women bottle, only with silver-metal neck and chocolate-brown rectangular top.\n\nThe model of the fragrance advertising campaign will be the actor Matthew McConaughey, who will next week join the designers in the NYC. When it comes to the choice of the model, the Dolce&Gabbana designers said that they wanted to have the sexiest man on the planet. And with regards to that, Gabbana adds that this is the first time that a model in one of D&G men\\'s fragrance campaigns appears in clothes.\n\nThe One for Men will be available in the US as EDT in two sizes – 50ml and 100ml bottles. Besides EDT the collection will include 100ml aftershave lotion, 75ml aftershave balm, 200ml shower gel and 75ml deodorant stick.",

Dolce Garden is a floral-gourmand fragrance that is said to radiate the pleasure of fun experiences. It is described as a fragrance of free thoughts and desires for fun experiences, inspired by shades of the gardens of Sicily in bloom.\n\nDolce Garden opens with white flowers, fresh and fruity notes (mandarin, magnolia, neroli), evoking Mediterranean sun. The heart includes petals of frangipani,ylang-ylang and coconut, which are said to create an ultra-feminine and sunny aura. In the base, the perfume turns slightly gourmand with vanilla, almond milk and woods. \n\n\nThe bottle of Dolce Garden is recognizable for the original shape, thick glass, curved lines and a cap sculpted in the shape of a flower, now in pink color.

The nose behind this fragrance is Violaine Collas. Top notes are Neroli, Green Apple and Italian Mandarin; middle notes are Jasmine, Coconut and Orange Blossom; base notes are Vanilla, Cashmere Wood and Cedar.\n\n\"Femininity finds new intensity in The Only One Eau de Parfum Intense, the latest edition in the The Only One line from Dolce&Gabbana Beauty. While The Only One Eau de Parfum celebrated a head-turning glamour that draws admiration from all, and The Only One 2 Eau de Parfum captured the power of desire, The Only One Eau de Parfum Intense now celebrates the most enchanting and fascinating qualities of The Only One woman. The absolute essence of mesmerizing allure and irresistible sensuality, this hypnotic fragrance is bewitching, beguiling and utterly addictive.\n\nThe Only One Eau de Parfum Intense builds on the floriental legacy of The Only One line with a captivating new scent. Like the woman it represents, the fragrance is an intricate combination of intense and solar sensuality. Alluringly feminine and irresistibly seductive, its signature lies in the surprising combination of dazzling gold\norange blossom contrasted with hypnotizing black vanilla.\n\nTop notes of sparkling Italian mandarin, crisp green apple accord and golden neroli essence illuminate the radiant floral heart of the fragrance. Notes of dazzling gold orange blossom mingle with the heady sensuality of jasmine absolute, and are softly enveloped by creamy, lush coconut essence, which lends a warm and sunny aura to the scent. Smooth, sweet notes of dark vanilla in the base amplify its addictive quality, underpinned by grounding cedar and cashmere woods.\n\nMaintaining the graphic architectural form of The Only One, the bottle is now reinvented in black, the iconic colour of Dolce&Gabbana, which reflects the hypnotic intensity of the fragrance within. The gold ring detail evokes the radiant elegance of The Only One woman, while the sinuous cursive script conjures her seductive silhouette.\n\nFor the video campaign, Italian director Matteo Garrone renewed his collaboration with actress Emilia Clarke. Set in a traditional trattoria in Rome, the film opens with Emilia surrounded by her friends. Encouraged by them, Emilia starts to sing the classic Italian song “Quando, Quando, Quando”, alongside a group of local musicians. Cheered on by the crowd, her natural aura and intense femininity draws the fascination of all around her. For the print campaign, the Morelli Brothers captured the vibrant energy of the scene, showcasing the spontaneous spirit so characteristic of their work.\"\n\nThe Only One Eau de Parfum Intense is available as a 30ml Eau de Parfum Intense, 50ml Eau de Parfum Intense and 100ml Eau de Parfum Intense from January 2020.",

    "description": "Lady Million by Rabanne is a Floral Fruity fragrance for women. Lady Million was launched in 2010. Lady Million was created by Anne Flipo, Beatrice Piquet, Dominique Ropion and Bruno Jovanovic. Top notes are Raspberry, Neroli and Amalfi Lemon; middle notes are Jasmine, African Orange Flower and Gardenia; base notes are White Honey, Patchouli and Amber.\n\n1 Million is one of the most popular fragrances launched in last several years. After the edition for men, women's version inspired by gold and wealth was expected. Two years after men's edition, fragrant lady finally appears - Lady Million! We can just assume if this lady wants to earn millions or look like a million dollar. It is perfectly clear that the woman represented by this edition radiates, dominates and possesses fiery character with incredible sensuality.\n\nFlacon of Lady Million is in tune with composition and theme of this edition. Instead of gold bullion, the flacon for women is designed as a golden diamond. While insinuating luxury and wealth, the fragrance prepares a surprising composition of intertwined floral, fresh and woody accords. Only diamond can compete with gold, so Lady Million is the perfect companion to modern and masculine 1 Million.\n\nThe Notes of Fragrance\n\nAnne Flipo, Béatrice Piquet and Dominque Ropion have all created scents for some of the biggest names in perfumery. But what path did they take to create Lady Million? “It was clear that this perfume had to be as charismatic as 1 Million, with as strong a signature, yet without a direct olfactory link. The Lady Million woman is dazzling, always seductive. This ‘playful’ aspect inspired us immensely. Lady Million is fresh, floral and woody, like a nectar of voluptuous flowers, trailing delicately but still very present. Powerfully seductive, the sparkle of bitter orange with a touch of raspberry reveals the first breath. A burst of neroli follows, smooth and bright. But then the lethal weapon of heady orange blossom slips out of its sheath. Its narcotic sweetness bewitches and grabs all attention. Then, joining with Arabian jasmine underlined by gardenia, the blend soars into something more carnal, yet ever subtle. Now the obsessive pulsing of patchouli enters the fray, pacifying the honey with an addictive and terribly tempting sweetness. Oriental spreads to become all enveloping, floating around the beauty, following each movement and offering its most beautiful facets”.\n\nDesigner of the attractive, luxurious flacon is Noe Duchaufour-Lawrance. The perfume will be available as 30, 50 and 80ml edp.\n\nWe can expect the fragrance on the market in July 2010. Lady Million makes men's fantasy and desires come true.

    "description": "Pure XS For Her by Rabanne is a Oriental Floral fragrance for women. Pure XS For Her was launched in 2018. The nose behind this fragrance is Quentin Bisch.\n\nAfter the success of last year's edition Paco Rabanne Pure XS for Him, advertised by Francisco Henriques, the woman's version is announced, described as wild and very provocative. Paco Rabanne makes a new step in the XS line by launching PURE XS FOR HER EAU DE PARFUM: an erotic floral-oriental edition advertised by the new brand ambassador, American actress and model Emily Ratajkowski.\n\nThe perfumer who composed and signed the newest Rabanne release is Quentin Bisch. \"A wildly provocative – and wildly untamed – floral created by Quentin Bisch, an impassioned and passionate perfumer at Givaudan. Inspired by one of his trips to Reunion Island, he came back to Paris obsessed with a heady, dazzling ylang-ylang. His goal: to bottle the essence of an orgasm, an explosion of the senses brought within reach with a distinctive Paco flair. Quentin has devised a detonating duo: magnetic ylang-ylang on an intriguing popcorn-note explosion. The notes vibrate against each other, together in tension. To trigger, in an avalanche of the senses, a moment of explosive erotica.\" \n\nThe formula explosion: ylang-ylang, vanilla, popcorn note, sandalwood, ambrette seeds.\n\nThe photo campaign is realized by the famous photographer Nathaniel Goldberg, who is also behind the Million and Pure XS campaigns. The face and muse for the newest Paco Rabanne creation is Emily Ratajkowski.\n\nThe sculptural bottle resembles the shape of the Black XS Eau de Parfum from 2018 with sharper edges then the previous Black XS editions, made in an ombre-style of powder pink shades, while the pink outer box is made with a velvety finish and gold-colored details.\n\nThe fragrance Pure XS For Her is available as a 30ml Eau de Parfum, 50ml Eau de Parfum and 80ml Eau de Parfum.",

    "description": "Phantom by Rabanne is a Woody Aromatic fragrance for men. Phantom was launched in 2021. Phantom was created by Anne Flipo, Dominique Ropion, Loc Dong and Juliette Karagueuzoglou. Top notes are Lavender, Lemon Zest and Amalfi Lemon; middle notes are Lavender, Earthy Notes, Apple, Smoke and Patchouli; base notes are Vanilla, Lavender and Vetiver.\n\nPHANTOM, the new fragrance for men by Paco Rabanne\n\nStep into the Paco Galaxy and join an intergalactic party where everyone is invited. Where you can be whoever you want to be. No matter who you are. No matter which planet you come from.\n\nThe essence of self-confidence fueled by feel good energies.\n\nA futuristic aromatic fragrance born from the clash between luxury craftmanship and new-tech.Using a cutting-edge creative process to select ingredients to make you feel energized, powerfully confident and sexy.\n\nA bold scent with notes of addictive creamy lavender, fusing energizing lemon and sexy woody vanilla.\n\nRadically different, totally disruptive: PHANTOM is our first connected bottle ever. Tap your phone on its top, and take off with your new wingman!\n\nA bold invitation to step outside the ordinary and celebrate life. 1000% feel-good. 1000% Paco Rabanne.\n\nPHANTOM, beyond perfumery: human emotion, boosted by A.I., crafted in Grasse\n\nHow does that work? By matching the luxury craftsmanship of perfumery with new tech. To conceive PHANTOM, Paco Rabanne assembled a dream team of four top-notch perfumers from IFF: Loc Dong for his crazy creativity, Juliette Karagueuzoglou for her exquisite knowledge of natural material, along with the Master Perfumers Dominique Ropion and Anne Flipo for their ability to fine-tune most powerful, long-lasting fragrances ever created by Paco Rabanne.\n\nTheir mission: to conceive a feel-good perfume that boosts your sexiness, confidence, and energy. Their super-power: Augmented Creativity, a cutting-edge creative process that uses A.I. to enhance human inspiration and galvanize creativity, applied to perfumery for the first time ever for Paco Rabanne.\n\nAugmented Creativity allowed the quartet to reach beyond their know-how and artistic sensibility. To experiment with unexpected scent pairings. To select the exact ingredients that stimulate sensations of sexiness, confidence, and energy; and fine-tune their dosages. \n\nSo, what does it smell like? A match. A clash. A mind-bending, addictive aromatic scent combining an energizing green flash of lemon with ultra-creamy lavender.\n\nThe secret ingredient boosting the energy of the lemon accord is a fantastic “vintage” molecule; styrallyl acetate. Scientific measures show that its radiant green fruity facets activate a sense of energy. In PHANTOM, the man-made material is combined with lush natural materials. Zesty lemon peel oil from Italy. Patchouli heart, a slightly smoky earthy note with an apple twist. And a streamlined woody note: vetiver heart.\n\nJumped up by that energizing green flash, lavender plays it smooth and creamy. Did we say lavender? We meant Lavender 3.0, custom-blended for Paco Rabanne to be irresistibly addictive…  Fresh lavandin heart, crafted for PHANTOM to enhance its most seductive properties. A stellar lavender oil. And organic lavandin absolute enfleurage 2.0 that brings out the ingredient’s most sensuous floral, aromatic, hay-like facets.\n\nWrap this Lavender 3.0 accord with sexy vanilla absolute and voilà!  Intensely feel-good. Powerfully sexy. Fantastically long-lasting. Now spray and enjoy! You’re all set to party.",

Top notes are Lemon and Sage; middle notes are Praline, Cinnamon, Tolu Balsam and Black Cardamom; base notes are Patchouli, Brazilian Rosewood and Black Amber.\n\nBlack XS was created in 2005 by Olivier Cresp. This perfume is definitely masculine. Knowing the desire of some women to wear men’s fragrances, it can be said that no woman would dare to wear Black XS despite of its soft and warm woodsy notes and even sweet notes of the drydown. Citrusy opening makes a great introduction into the sweet and spicy heart of the composition. Deep and dark sweet fruity notes of the heart are replaced by woodsy notes and amber in the base. In such sweet surrounding amber tends to take a tobacco nuance, while the musk tames the extreme masculinity of this scent. Black XS features fresh lemon notes, Kalamanzi fruit, tagetes, sage, praline, cardamom, cinnamon, Tou balsam, rosewood, black amber, patchouli and ebony.",

    "description": "Femme by Hugo Boss is a Floral Fruity fragrance for women. Femme was launched in 2006. Top notes are Freesia, Tangerine and Black Currant; middle notes are Bulgarian Rose, Lily and Jasmine; base notes are Lemon Tree, Apricot and Amber.\n\nFemme is an ode dedicated to a Woman. Boss woman is above all romantic and cheerful. She is a dreamer; she is the very essence of feminity, just like imagined by men. The perfume is casual, sparkling and joyful, with a luminous fruity opening composed of tangerine and black currant with a touch of freesia. The floral heart is gentle and lovely as a ‘bridal bouquet’, composed of white flowers, Madagascar jasmine, lily and rose. The longlasting trace wafts with notes of musk in harmony with delicate apricot skin and lemon tree wood. The fragrance was created in 2000.",

Top note is Red Apple; middle notes are African Orange Flower and White Flowers; base notes are Vanilla, Sandalwood and Olive Tree.\n\nIn July 2009, the house of Hugo Boss will launch a new fragrance Boss Orange, which will be presented by famous actress Sienna Rose Miller.

In 2007, she won the EMA Futures Award, Environmental Media Awards.\n\nEdition for women Boss Orange attracted our attention with its advertising face, actress Sienna Miller, which represents urban, natural, modern woman searching for a feminine fragrance, completing her spring image with cheerful aromas. Beautiful, intriguing, free, charismatic and spontaneous Boss woman is represented perfectly with aromas of new Boss Orange.\n\nTop notes describe strong personality of a woman, her enthusiasm and energy. Notes of sweet apple reveal the first, delicate taste of feminine passions, adding a floral, soft and charming heart. White flowers, which are tame and gentle, are mixed with orange blossom, giving an optimistic impression. A base includes sandalwood, olive wood and creamy vanilla, which make the finish very characteristic, passionate and warm.\n\nThe flacon is very modern; it combines elements of metal and glass (orange glass stones). 7 identical, symbolic stones cut light and characterize 7 chakras, deeper spiritual dimensions. Stream of energy through human body is symbolically presented with design of the new Boss flacon.\n\nThe new fragrance Hugo Boss - Boss Orange is available as 30, 50 and 75ml EDT, with an accompanying perfumed body care line: 150 ml deo spray, 200 ml bath and 200 ml body lotion.",

Of note is the absence of lavender that was a key feature in so many of the other Luna Rossa editions.\n\nPrada Luna Rossa Black is available as a 50 and 100 ml Eau de Parfum.",

    "description": "Prada Amber Pour Homme (Prada Man) by Prada is a Oriental Fougere fragrance for men. Prada Amber Pour Homme (Prada Man) was launched in 2006. The nose behind this fragrance is Daniela Andrier. Top notes are Neroli, Cardamom, Bergamot and Mandarin Orange; middle notes are Myrrh, Musk, Orange Blossom, Geranium and Vetiver; base notes are Saffron, Vanilla, Labdanum, Tonka Bean, Leather, Sandalwood and Patchouli.\n\nPrada Oriental Pour Homme is the first Prada fragrance, launched after the female one, also in oriental composition based upon amber. The perfumer Daniela Roche-Andrier created the composition in four basic accords : Oriental – the main accord, rich and complex oriental base which includes amber, vanilla, labdanum, Tonka and patchouli; Fougere – or the aromatic accord with a remarkable soapy note, includes notes of pelargonium, vetiver, orange blossom and myrrh at the heart; Cologne – the refreshing citrusy top of bergamot, mandarin, neroli and cardamom; Leather – leather note is present at the base of the composition (leather, saffron and sandalwood). Miuccia Prada, the granddaughter of the founder, who turned grandfather’s leather goods design into a large company, personally took part in creating of this perfume. “I just tried to imagine what I would like if I were a man.” Maybe due to the fact that it was created by a female hand, the fragrance is not aggressive at all, like it might have been expected from an oriental fragrance with leather and amber. Instead, it is very elegant and masculine gentle.",

Popularity of this fragrance (regardless of its unusual composition and a heavy character, and perhaps exactly because of that) is easy to explain because it reflects a desire of every woman to attract and seduce, and this fragrance has openly sexual character. Unusual lustful composition is created with the sensual musk in its centre, surrounded by orange, osmanthus and amber. The base unites vanilla, amber and vetiver. Intensive sharp scent with hidden and scarcely discernible densely-sweet nuance in the centre later turns into a soft and balmy powder. The aggression disappears and the fragrance becomes tame and gentle.\n\nAt first, in 2004 it was launched as EDT in a black bottle in pink outer box. Then in 2006 the EDP was created in a pink bottle and black outer box. The composition was changed, despite the fact that the musk note has remained in the centre of the composition. EDP has rose note in the top. The trace has become more mysterious and rich, thanks to exotic woods – patchouli and sandalwood. Both variances of the fragrance can be described as floral chypre with intensive musk nuance, only the first one is sharper and more aggressive, while the second one is sweeter and softer. The creators of these fragrances are Christine Nagel and Francis Kurkdjian.",

Top notes are Jasmine, Bulgarian Rose and Orange Blossom; middle note is Musk; base notes are Coumarin, Cedar, Vetiver and Patchouli.\n\nWith Narciso Eau de Parfum (2014), Narciso Rodriguez continued with its musky scented creations in minimalistic bottles that began with the debut fragrance Narciso Rodriguez For Her (2003). In June, 2015, Narciso Eau de Toilette was presented in a square, black bottle. The collection's new fragrance for early 2016 is housed in a bottle of delicate skin color that befits the name Narciso Poudrée.\n\nThis story of sensuality and seduction continues with a new chapter - velvety, powerful and delicate at the same time; warm and strong Narciso Poudrée. The goal was to create a fragrant cloud that highlights a natural and mature femininity. Powdery musk dominates the heart of the perfume, which opens with a floral combination of Bulgarian rose and white jasmine. Woody notes of vetiver, black and white cedar end the composition.\n\nThe face of the perfume is Raquel Zimmermann. Narciso Poudrée is available as 30, 50 and 90 ml Eau de Parfum.",

An exploration of musc’s raw power reveals a transcendent new fragrance that portrays the ever fascinating enigma of modern femininity. for her MUSC NOIR heightens the addictive nature of the original for her with an exploration of the darker, more intense aspects of narciso rodriguez’s signature musc.\n\n“FOR HER MUSC NOIR HAS A MYSTERIOUSLY, DARK AND SEDUCTIVE QUALITY ABOUT IT THAT IS RARE AND UNIQUE.” NARCISO RODRIGUEZ\n\nfor her MUSC NOIR is presented in a completely translucent bottle, revealing the mystery within. Only a delicate pink juice, echoing the original for her, adorns the signature bottle while a black cap alludes to scent’s darker facets. The for her MUSC NOIR bottle is an object of pure artistry, radiating with a weightless intensity and a bold luminosity that celebrates the sublime fragrance within.\n\n“To work with musc is a perfumer’s dream,” says MUSC NOIR perfumer, Sonia Constant. The composition of for her MUSC NOIR includes a darker musc with a rich olfactory depth, both mysterious and extremely sensual. Leathery suede accords transform the heart of musc and intensify the sinuous skin-on-skin sensuality of the fragrance.

When for her MUSC NOIR is layered with for her PURE MUSC, it becomes an even more memorable statement, an experience of pure luxury—your personal signature scent.\n\n“I STRIVE TO CREATE PERFUMES THAT ENHANCE AND REVEAL WOMEN, WITHOUT TRANSFORMING WHO THEY ARE. THE WOMAN I THOUGHT OF WHEN CREATING MUSC NOIR WAS A CONFIDENT WOMAN, A WOMAN WHO DARES TO TAKE RISKS.” SONIA CONSTANT\n\nThe campaign film explores what is both tangible and inexplicable about modern feminine grace, strength, and confidence. With their signature artistry, Inez & Vinoodh use a dramatic play of light and shadow to portray the magic of a women’s sensual confidence and self-professed power. Shot in brilliant tropical light, the campaign has an ethereal, dream-like quality composed of fragmented memories and precious moments that are beautifully mesmerizing. Pink accents recall the new bottle’s luminous glow, while the darker elements reflect the sensuality and mystery of musc.\n\nThe new face of for her MUSC NOIR, Lola Nicon, is a startlingly fresh beauty that’s both raw and refined—she draws you in with her unabashed sensuality and ineffable honesty that resonate powerfully from within. It is Lola Nicon’s visual reflections and sublime vulnerability that embodies the strength and sensuality of the women who inspired for her. Lola Nicon’s presence, both bold and enigmatic is captured in a series of captivating images that are otherworldly in their pure grace and poetic precision.",

Top notes are Pear and Melon; middle notes are Freesia and Rose; base notes are Musk, Patchouli, Rhuburb and Amber.\n\nJo Malone presents new fragrance, English Pear and Freesia, which unites English landscapes and seasons which are connected with souls of the British.\n\nInspiration for this fragrance were also verses by one of the last great romantic poets, John Keats (Ode to Autumn).\n\nJo Malone's creative studio chose a perfumer for this collection. That is Christine Nagel known for numerous successful creations (Miss Dior Cherie, Narciso Rodriguez, Rose Absolue, Delices etc). The fragrance is ripe, juicy and thoroughly designed.\n\nNuances of freesia and pear are very complex, since ripe pears were necessary to achieve a certain note to sound unique in composition of the fragrance.\n\nPear in the moment of perfect ripeness has crispy structure of skin and juicy fruit. Pear is combined with quince which introduces honey sweetness and is surrounded with white freesia and wild climbing rose.\n\nA base of the composition is created of green, fresh and sour nuances of rhubarb along with warm and subtle aromas of patchouli, amber and white musk that stay in a trail.\n\nJo Malone English Pear and Freesia is available as 30 and 100ml EDC. The fragrance arrives on the market in September 2010.",

According to a representative of the house of Jo Malone, the new fragrance starts renovation of the house. Advertising poster features a model instead of a flacon, which is unusual for media campaigns of Jo Malone, since we are used to seeing flacons surrounded with main ingredients of compositions.\n\nCreator of the perfume is Christine Nagel who presented a new version of bluebell, composed of various notes, including green fresh notes, flowers (lily of the valley, rose hip) and spicy chord of cloves. Bluebell is a wild forest flower and its scent provides a moist echo of summer forest. English bluebell is an endangered species, Jo Malone gave a donation to Woodland Trust. Genuine bluebell does not take part in the composition, but its recreation composed of various notes.\n\nTop notes: bluebell and cloves\nHeart: lily of the valley, jasmine, rose hip\nBase: white amber and musk\n\nJo Malone Wild Bluebell arrives on the market in sale from Sept 1st 2011, as 30 and 100 ml Cologne accompanied with body care products and scented candle.",

Mesmerized by her beauty, after becoming emperor, he made her his wife as Mumtaz Mahal, meaning the \"Jewel of the Palace\". After the wedding, the prince and Mumtaz were inseparable, in war and in peace. She had given 13 children to Shahjahan and died during the birth of their 14th child at the age of 39. Her death devastated Shah Jahan and had built Taj Mahal in memory of his wife and their undying love. Shalimar is named after ‘The Gardens of Shalimar’.It was Mumtaz’s favorite garden. Shalimar is one of the best selling perfumes ever and its magic is undeniable. Perfume is composed of citrus notes; lemon and bergamot, jasmine, may rose, opoponax, Tonka bean, vanilla, iris, Peru balsam and gray amber. The coolness of the citrus notes lead to a floral heart ending with a warm and luxurious trail.",

Top notes are Sour Cherry, Almond, Red Berries and Bergamot; middle notes are Licorice, Rose, Tea and Taif Rose; base notes are Vanilla, Anise, Tonka Bean, Patchouli and Iris.\n\nThe house of Guerlain launched an exclusive and limited edition La Petite Robe Noire in February 2009. In February 2011, it also presented the second limited edition of the line—La Petite Robe Noire 2. In early 2012, Guerlain decides to relaunch the debut and to offer the fragrance to a broad market. The new La Petite Robe Noire is modified, developed by the in-house perfumer Thierry Wasser.\n\nInspired by the elegance and eternity of a little black dress, the perfume exudes Parisian chic and gracefulness. It opens with playful and sparkling aromas of black cherry, bergamot, red berries and almond. Bulgarian and Turkish roses rule the heart, further developing with notes of licorice and smoked black tea. Aniseed, tonka bean, vanilla, iris and patchouli form the base.\n\nThe bottles of La Petite Robe Noire collection are replicas of the classical vials of the house, such as L'Heure Bleue. The dress print has been altered so that each of the past three bottles shows a different shape of this clothing. The animated ad campaign was created by French artists Olivier Kuntzel and Florence Deygas.\n\nThe new La Petite Robe Noire is available as 30, 50 and 75 ml Eau de Parfum.",

    "description": "L'Instant de Guerlain by Guerlain is a Oriental Floral fragrance for women. L'Instant de Guerlain was launched in 2003. The nose behind this fragrance is Maurice Roucel. Top notes are Mandarin Orange, Red Apple and Bergamot; middle notes are Magnolia, Iris, Ylang-Ylang and Jasmine; base notes are White Honey, Vanille, Amber, Benzoin and Musk.\n\nThe new Guerlain perfume (2003) for the first time contains magnolia. This delicate and complicated perfume is in harmony with the citrus honey note, which can be scented from the top all the way to the bottom notes. This is a innovative perfume composition built like a \\'double olfactory pyramid\\'. The perfume opens with fresh citrus notes – mandarin and bergamot as one fragrant composition, while the other one gives out the shine of white flowers – magnolia, ylang-ylang, and sambac jasmine. The sensuality comes later with vanilla, benzoin, and musk, which leave magical intimate trace. Eau de Toilette has a limited version of the fragrance with iris in the centre – L’Instant Eau de Noël Iris Millésime, while the regular one has an apple-sweets nuance.",

Top notes are Angelica, Pear and Pink Pepper; middle notes are Jasmine and Caraway; base notes are Angelica, Vanilla and Cedar.\n\nFor the event of opening of renovated main boutique La Maison Guerlain (The House of Guerlain) at 68 Avenue des Champs-Elysées, Paris, Guerlain launched exclusive line of three perfumes – L \\'Art et la Matière (The Art and (raw) Material, a pun after the French expression L\\'Art et la Manière – the art and manners). Three famous noses were invited to work on the perfumes using the highest quality materials. The perfumes were launched in 2005.\n\nAngélique Noire is the third fragrance of the series, created by Daniela Andrièr. It was an attempt to reproduce the famous compositions of the house. Sweet and strong beginning with spices and piquant freshness of bergamot is mixing with milky bitterness of almond and vanilla notes. Unusual harmony of the fresh bergamot and sweet vanilla is a trademark of classical compositions of Guerlain. Spicy harshness of the beginning is contrasting creamy and sweet base which includes mildly spicy and sugary notes of angelica.",

Liquid of the flacon is coloured in warm pink.\n\nComposition of Shalimar Parfum Initial is created of citruses, green notes, flowers, woody accords and oriental scents. Starting from citruses, the composition adds zest of bergamot and orange. Rose flowers and jasmine enjoy embrace of woody accords of vetiver and patchouli, while oriental notes of vanilla, white musk and luscious tonka give seductive warmth to the whole composition. Green notes provide a fresher tone to the composition.\n\nFace of the advertising campaign for the new Shalimar Parfum Initial is Natalia Vodianova, photographed naked. These photos are supposed to represent innocence and chastity of woman's body, new Eve. The photos were taken by Paolo Roversi.\n\nShalimar Parfum Initial is presented to the market in March 2011 as a 40, 60 and 100ml EDP.",

However, Guerlain is not afraid to surprise, and even provoke.\n\nThere is a delicate and soft violet waiting in the top notes, followed by a red-fruit cocktail with raspberry domination. The heart is floral-sweet and composed of violet, rose, and orange blossom. At the end, sweet resins and balsams together have joined iris and tonka bean to round out the composition. The creators of Insolence are Maurice Roucel and Sylvaine Delacourte, and the half-sphere bottle with the rose-like stopper was created by Serge Mansau. The perfume was launched in 2006.",

    "description": "Kenzo Amour by Kenzo is a Oriental Vanilla fragrance for women. Kenzo Amour was launched in 2006. Kenzo Amour was created by Daphné Bugey and Olivier Cresp. Top notes are Rice and White Tea; middle notes are Frangipani, Cherry Blossom and Heliotrope; base notes are Vanille, Musk, Incense and Thanaka Wood. This perfume is the winner of 2 awards: FiFi Award Fragrance Of The Year Women`s Nouveau Niche 2007 and FiFi Award Best Packaging Women`s Luxe 2007.\n\nKenzo Amour is gentle, sensual and joyful fragrance, a romantic and aromatic journey to Asia. The perfume starts with soft and attractive aroma of Frangipani blossom which possess a very fine almond-like aroma. The smell of these flowers fascinated one of the two creators of this perfume, Daphne Bugey, during her visit to Indonesia. Of course, the Far East can not be imagined without Japanese cherry blossom.\n\nFrom Japan we travel to China. The heart features very comfortable and soft aroma of Chinese white tea. The composition continues with thin milky aroma of Thailand rice, and to the gorgeous base which includes woodsy, balsamic, and musky notes, and vanilla. Mysterious incense diffuses on skin in all its nuances: nice wooden note and bitterly ranis interlace with soft and powdery note of Burman Tanaka wood with aroma reminiscent of sandalwood and amber. The composition ends with sweet and soft vanilla, clearly distinguished in the base.\n\nKenzo Amour was created by Daphne Bugey and Olivier Cresp in 2005.\n\nThe bottles design is worth mentioning as well. Three bottles, three colors, the same scent. The 30ml (1 fl.oz.) bottle is in fuchsia color, the 50ml (1.7 fl.oz.) is white and the 100ml (3.4 fl.oz.) bottle is colored orange. As imagined by the designer, those colors are romantic colors of Asia. The colorful Kenzo bird on the outer box symbolizes passionate love and freedom of traveling.",

Top note is Red Fruits; middle notes are Peony, Floral Notes and Egyptian Jasmine; base note is Ambroxan.\n\nThe all-seeing eye is a major imprint of the collection and alludes to the force of the third eye and to spiritual protection from above,\" said Kenzo art-directors Humberto Leon and Carol Lim.\n\nIts the first fragrance by the new art directors.\n\nKenzo entrusted the fragrance creation to Francis Kurkdjian. \"It opens with a surge of flowers by the armful, from petals to bouquets, with bursts of sweetness... It's a brilliant fragrance, with a lively sparkling trail, a crazy rock nectar with an intoxicating scent that titillates the nose. A shot of energy that benefits the soul.\"\n\nThe key note of the fragrance is Ambroxan: \"Ambroxan gives the flowers the enticing quality that we need to fogret them as such. It's a bit like the sfumato in the paintings of Leonardo da Vinci, when you juxtapose power. It acts like the fog, when the mist blurs the contours of things all around, and we only recognize their hazy outline.\"",

The nose behind this fragrance is Francis Kurkdjian. Top note is Mandarin Blossom; middle notes are Orange Blossom and Gardenia; base notes are Honey, Vetiver and Rose.\n\nElie Saab Le Parfum Eau de Toilette is a new version of the first perfume by designer Elie Saab, feminine and elegant Elie Saab Le Parfum from 2011.\n\n“I come from a Mediterranean city bathed in heat and light, surrounded by vibrant nature loaded with fragrance. One scent stays firmly in my mind, that of orange blossom. The house where I grew up was surrounded by orange trees and when the breezes came through the branches they brought their ethereal fragrance with them\", said Saab.\n\nThe scent is sharp and sensual floral - woody. This version is also signed by perfumer Francis Kurkdjian who pays tribute to the designer's memories of the Mediterranean and the scent of orange blossom in the air, so that it is the key ingredient of the composition once again. Aromas of mandarin tree blossom provide tart freshness to the heart of orange blossom and gardenia, placed at the base of vetiver, rose and honey.\n\nThe silhouette of the original bottle became \"slimmer\" for this edition. The fragrance is available as 30, 50 and 90 ml Eau de Toilette.",

    "description": "L'Eau Couture by Elie Saab is a Floral fragrance for women. L'Eau Couture was launched in 2014. The nose behind this fragrance is Francis Kurkdjian. Top notes are Magnolia and Calabrian bergamot; middle note is Orange Blossom; base notes are Green Almond and Vanilla.\n\nL`Eau Couture is the olfactory continuation of the designer s Ready-to-Wear 2014 Spring-Summer collection, in which ethereal fabrics as light as petals chisel a magical fusion between woman and nature. It captures the ecstasy of nature blossoming in an urban springtime setting.\n\nFor L`Eau Couture, Francis Kurkdjian dreamed up a brand new tribute to freshness, which he leads into sensuality characterised by absolute sophistication. L`Eau Couture reinterprets accords in a way never seen before.\n\n\"The idea to create a Couture Eau is quite uncommon in this register. It s a sophisticated, sensual freshness, far removed from the conventions found in fragrances usually created in this repertoire\" - Francis Kurkdjian\n\nHere, Orange Blossom unveils an unexpected facet, inspired by the fleeting period when the newly-bloomed blossoms exude slightly almondy notes. As its traditional honey-like aromas are subdued, Orange Blossom inhabits the fragrance like a poetic whisper. Its subtly textured floral freshness, upheld by intricate transparency, is an echo of sun-kissed femininity.\n\nA fusional Accord of crisp Green Almond unites the blossoms with the bed of vanilla at the perfume s base. An irresistibly light Vanilla Infusion reveals the transparency of the floral notes, which it enshrouds in an addictive aura, creating a soft and luminous sillage.\n\nDressed in an elegant water-green box, the delicately facetted bottle reveals a crystalline green juice. Radiance and transparency resonate like an echo of the original freshness of this new fragrance. L'Eau Couture lets us discover freshness like a promise of new emotions. It invites us to dive into new sensations born of the lightness associated with the newness of spring.\n\nThe newest fragrance by Elie Saab named Le Parfum L'Eau Couture will be available in 30, 50 and 90ml EDT bottles before Spring 2014.",

The debut, Elie Saab Le Parfum from 2011, reflects the sparkling light of midday. The soft light of early morning is captured by the Eau de Toilette edition from 2012, while the magic moment of dusk is introduced with the new version Le Parfum Eau de Parfum Intense coming out in Fall 2013.\n\n\"As the sun slips below the horizon, the senses become inflamed. Ultra-sensual, she steps forth in a shimmering sheath dress. The embodiment of ultimate femininity. A regal bearing, a confident stride… She knows that she will not be easily forgotten.

An unforgettable trail, a reminiscence of her aura.\"\n\nLe Parfum Eau de Parfum Intense fragrance is announced as ultra sensual and feminine. Its oriental-floral composition opens with bright orange blossom accord. The heart includes intoxicating and opulent flower of ylang-ylang mixed with rose honey.

    "description": "Nuit Noor by Elie Saab is a Oriental Floral fragrance for women. Nuit Noor was launched in 2016. The nose behind this fragrance is Francis Kurkdjian.\n\n\"Nuit Noor is a scent of contrasts, between night and light – noor in Arabic –, power and sensuality, roundness and opulence. A radiant flower embraced by the night, in a shimmering halo of city lights. A fragrant journey to Beirut, the cradle of the ELIE SAAB Couture House… For this new opus, Elie Saab opens the doors of his home in the seaside quarter of Gemmayzeh. At our feet, Beirut comes alive as the night falls. Like jewels, its glittering lights, reflected by the sea, set the dark, velvety sky aglow…\n\nTo express the contrast that gives Nuit Noor its name, Francis Kurkdjian revisits an iconic. Oriental accord of rose and woods, creating two complementary notes to translate light and the night. In Nuit Noor, light is embodied by a tender, honeyed bouquet, where a soft, creamy Rose blooms voluptuously… To enhance its radiance, the perfumer blends it with a particularly refined essence of Ylang-ylang from Madagascar, whose narcotic scent suffuses the fragrance with a solar aura. To conjure the night, Francis Kurkdjian has blended a dark accord of spicy woody notes that runs through the composition. Sizzling Black Pepper adds vibrancy to the sensuous facets of the Rose and Ylang-ylang. In turn, it lights up the Incense, whose mysterious tendrils of smoke rise against a majestic, velvety backdrop of Indonesian Patchouli.\n\nA dusky sillage of spices, woods and resins that carries Nuit Noor from dusk to dawn… An icon of modernity in the Middle-East, this lively, vibrant, thriving city is the muse of Nuit Noor.\n\nAvailable in 75 Eau de Parfum flacon.",

    "description": "Signorina Eleganza by Salvatore Ferragamo is a Chypre Floral fragrance for women. Signorina Eleganza was launched in 2014. The nose behind this fragrance is Sophie Labbe. Top notes are Pear and Grapefruit; middle notes are Osmanthus and Almond; base notes are Patchouli and Leather.\n\nElegance has always been a defining element of Salvatore Ferragamo creations. Full of grace and refinement, they are further enhanced by the impeccable taste for which the Florentine brand is famous worldwide. In tribute to this sophistication, Salvatore Ferragamo presents Signorina Eleganza, a luxurious fragrance that celebrates feminine grace and seduction.\n\nThe fresh head notes of grapefruit and pear are a vivacious and stimulating introduction.\n\nAlmond powder and golden osmanthus petals create a delicate yet intense heart, adding a touch of indulgent luxury.\n\nThe base notes of patchouli and white leather create a dry-down effect that leaves a luscious, lingering scent on the skin.\n\nThe packaging of Signorina Eleganza in a nude beige palette conveys a delicate and refined charm. The Eleganza logo in embossed gold adds an extra touch of excellence.\n\nThe precious golden base engraved with the logo in relief gives the bottle a magnificent appearance while the famous gros grain Vara bow comes in two shades of beige.\n\nSalvatore Ferragamo celebrates chic young women creating a unique style signature of timeless modernity, creativity and a hint of audacity. A girl playing with her different characters: sophisticated and cheeky, like Signorina Eau de Parfum, elegant and seductive like Signorina Eleganza and unpredictably mysterious like Signorina Misteriosa ...because Signorina is a different Signorina every day. “My life is a play” is her credo: Grace Hartzel perfectly embodies the three personalities of Signorina deciding when and how to let the play start, but always remaining the same person. #mylifeisaplay\n\nSignorina Eleganza is available in three sizes: 30, 50 and 100ml EDP. Perfumer is Sophie Labbe from IFF.",

    "description": "LouLou by Cacharel is a Oriental Floral fragrance for women. LouLou was launched in 1987. The nose behind this fragrance is Jean Guichard. Top notes are Plum, Chinese Cinnamon Wood, Iris, Violet, Lily, Anise, Jasmine, Mimosa and Cassia; middle notes are Ylang-Ylang, Heliotrope, Orris Root, Orange Blossom and Tahitian Tiare Flower; base notes are Incense, Vanilla, Benzoin, Sandalwood and Musk.\n\nOne of the top selling perfumes of the 1980's, one of those bold, powerful, distinguishing, and timeless fragrances. LouLou is a controversial perfume that people either like or dislike, the one that provokes different emotions, and indifference for sure is not one of them. LouLou is a fragrance dangerous like Pandora's Box. LouLou is like an intoxicating dark red flower which lures you into the depths of a dark and dangerous forest. Yet it is impossible to resist, and once you are engrossed by its warm scent, you simply have to let go and follow it; you must pick the forbidden fruit.\n\nThe perfume is built around the beautiful and sensual scent of tiare flower, which is the Tahitian symbol of welcome. The top notes are composed of violet, plum, black currant, marigold, and anise; the heart of sweet tiare flower is accentuated with the notes of tuberose, ylang-ylang, and orange blossom; and all of that is followed by a powdery trace of orris and tonka bean and a sensual mix of vanilla and balsam.\n\nThis sensual, wild, and mysterious perfume is captured in an opaque blue and red flacon of a simple octagonal and straight-lined shape that narrows towards the top. An earlier version of the bottle was designed like Aladdin’s lamp with a blue octagonal base and a red spiky top. It comes in a cardboard outer box painted in red flowers and colorful vegetation against a very dark forest.",

Anais Anais Premier Delice was created by Olivier Cresp and Dora Baghriche. Top notes are Pear, Orange, Bergamot and Galbanum; middle notes are Peony and Hyacinth; base notes are Cacao and Cedar.\n\nOne of the most successful new versions of 2014 is presented in April 4. This is the latest fragrance of the house of Cacharel, which succeeds one of the classics of the house and perfumery in general – legendary edition from 1978, fragrance Anais Anais which gave us a treat with an opulent blend of lily, hyacinth, lily of the valley, orange blossom, jasmine…\n\nANAIS ANAIS PREMIER DELICE is not the first successor of this popular edition, but is arriving after Anais Anais Eau Legere from 2006 and Anais Anais Flower Edition from 2007. Unlike them, the new fragrance is turning curse to delicate gourmand shades, while highlighting cocoa in the composition. The fragrance is announced as symbol of love and passion!\n\nTop notes of the new edition and luminous and citrusy. Fresh and sparkling notes of bergamot and orange are supported by lemonish galbanum. Green pear zests contribute to juicier but not to sweeter opening. The heart of the composition does not move away from its older sister and offer a romantic spring bouquet full of freshness with a floral choir of hyacinth and peony. Soft gourmand cocoa trail remains in the base along with precious woody shades of cedar. The fragrance is signed by perfumer of the house of Firmenich - Olivier Cresp and Dora Baghriche.\n\nFlacon of the new fragrance Anais Anais Premier Delice is made of glass and illustration on the tag and outer carton reminds us irresistibly of the design of previous editions. Color of liquid is pale pink. The perfume arrives as 30ml and 50 ml Eau de Toilette.",

The brand stated that they wanted to offer a different version of previous fragrances from the Jean Paul Gaultier collection respecting the well-known DNA of the brand and \"to stop the fever of limited editions.\" The goal is to create something more spicy, festive, sexy and fun, from the bottle to the campaign.\n\nThe advertising campaign was created as a mix of sex and politics. “We decided to tell the life of ‘Madame La Ministre.’ She’s a government minister who goes partying at night in Paris’ Pigalle neighborhood and makes her way directly into the office for her day job. The advertising face is model Vanessa Axente, leaving a club in a form-fitting black number. In her waiting car, filled with friends, she’s literally cut out of the outfit as her car speeds through the streets of Paris toward the Élysée Palace, where she steps out elegantly in a tailored outfit to join colleagues,\" explains Jose Manuel Albesa, chief brand officer of Puig.\n\nScandal is available in 30 ml Eau de Parfum; 50ml Eau de Parfum and 80 ml Eau de Parfum. In addition to the Eau de Parfum, the collection also includes perfumed body care products: a Shower Gel of 200ml and a Body Lotion of 200ml.\n\nThe new bottle was updated in 2026.",

    "description": "Scandal Pour Homme by Jean Paul Gaultier is a Oriental Woody fragrance for men. Scandal Pour Homme was launched in 2021. Scandal Pour Homme was created by Quentin Bisch, Christophe Raynaud and Natalie Gracia-Cetto. Top notes are Mandarin Orange and Clary Sage; middle notes are Caramel and Tonka Bean; base note is Vetiver.\n\n\"Oh how you loved him, that boxer Jean Paul Gaultier!\n\nA boxer can come out swinging but never throws in the towel even when he’s as pleased as punch. A boxer has the aura of a King. A boxer is so much more than his punches in the ring. Because a boxer - oh how scandalous can soothe the world in a second. This boxer, he’s all that, and more!\n\nIt’s at 325 rue Saint Martin, the Jean Paul HQ, that we find him today. In a huge hall, but this time, a ring instead of a catwalk.\n\nSo it’s as if surrounded by family that our boxer arrives: conquering and adored! Around him, the craziest, freest tribe you could ever imagine: Here, everyone can be what they want to be! Here, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Here, life, but better. A mixing of styles, a mix of lifestyles, JPG always and forever at your service!\n\nA clique, dressed in the most iconic looks of the House to celebrate yesterday, today, and especially tomorrow because “a beautiful piece of clothing is alive” as said by Mr. Gaultier himself. And of course, it’s a story of desire.\n\nIn the ring, the scandalous Imaan Hammam waits for the unbeatable Parker Van Noord. He, torrid dimples. Her, an incomparable punch and endless legs. The King of the Ring finds himself here with a challenge where he knows the ropes. If our Scandals reach KO - it’ll be a love match!\n\nThe fragrance: Quentin Bisch, Christophe Raynaud and Natalie Cetto took as their starting point a fragrance that would be a true reflection of everything that Jean Paul Gaultier is. A very modern woody oriental.\n\nAs the starting point they took a “knock-out” freshness, sage and the full-fruit mandarin, pulp and seeds included. That’s the head. Next, they brought in an uppercut “contact” with an overdose of totally addictive tonka bean, to create a truly delectable skin note. That’s the heart. Finally, they summoned into the ring a sensual vetiver to introduce the vibrant force of freshly cut wood. That’s the base. In all these points of delicious tension, a fragrance that boxes in all categories.\n\nThe bottle:  Almost a self-portrait, it says so much about our boxer. Luxurious, a significant weight in the hand, imposing, clear, and like a boxing ring, not square. It’s the deciding scene where anything could happen… and the matches will go on for several rounds because, of course… it’s refillable! The lid is our champion’s crown, and there is nothing traditional about this king: who has the cheeky excess of a Freddie Mercury. Un-pining this bottle every morning is quite tempting. Perfect to hold, like a talisman. He’s got some luck this King of the Ring!\n\nThe case: A box for boxing. Red velvet, but you could say crimson, bordeaux, ruby, garnet. Red is the thrust and speaks to lust. Just stroking it sends you crazy. The hand is placed above, for full, immediate contact. Live and direct to the senses. The crown is engraved, like a seal of victory, a most royal hook. This box tells a story.\n\nDirected by Jonas Lindstroem. Casting: Imaan Hammam & Parker Van Noord. Rossy De Palma, Raya Martigny, Dustin Muchuvitz, Nicola Lecourt Mansion, Mounia Nassangar, Naomi Janumala, Nina Marker, Anna Cleveland, Kim Dohyun, Lizette Pinto e Melo, Marjan Jonkman, Nicolas Huchard, Vladimir McCrary, Sid Oudainia, Alexis Chaparro, Mehdi Douache, Lorenzo Sutto, Vetle Majambere, Chun Soot, Jean-Paul Roy.\n\nSCANDAL POUR HOMME is available as a 50ml, 100ml, and 150ml Eau de Toilette, and in refill flacons in the size of 200ml. The collection offers body care products as well: 150ml deodorant spray, deo stick, and 150ml all-over shower gel.",

    "description": "So Scandal! by Jean Paul Gaultier is a Floral Fruity fragrance for women. So Scandal! was launched in 2020. So Scandal! was created by Fabrice Pellegrin and Daphné Bugey.\n\n\"She walked past me without even a second glance. A storm in just a tuxedo jacket, and her bare legs.Like an endless compass that one would follow to the end of the world. So sexy.As she strolled by, I saw them all stop mid-sentence. A shock in slow motion. So scandal-ized!\nFaintly amused by the silent turbulence she sowed in her wake, she heads straight to her table, the one with her gang. Unapologetically determinedthat the show goes on, her attitude had no latitude for discretion or reserve. This woman lives on in my memory, to the point of obsession: her perfume, SoScandal! by Jean Paul Gaultier.\n\nThe very essence of a scandal.\nOrange blossom, so bright, Sambac jasmine so opulent and tuberose so powdery: a threesome of white flowers that one could have sworn would deliver an angelic sweetness.\nAnd boom! It’s a bomb of all that is sensual!\nJuicy raspberry, a gourmetmilkiness with sexy undertones presses all the carnal buttons. A simple aphrodisiac, a deadly weapon that’s deeply erotic.\n\nDaphne Bugey and Fabrice Pellegrin. It’s not their first tango.\nShe says \"freedom is to be unafraid\".\nHe has his own motto engraved on the back of his watch, \"carpe diem\", as if to better savour the scandal he created with his partner in crime.\n\nLanguidly pleasing pleats, round hips and a tiny waist,legs akimbo the up side is down. A handmade scandal. A pink sap courses through this objet, like the life juice of a dangerously irresistible fruit. The design, the drapery, this bottle sets the scene for a story that is meant to be written all through the night and maybe even into day break. Trouble and troubling sensations guaranteed.\n\nThe color of a grand cru, intensely raspberry, almost bordeaux.\nVelvety shades. For a colour that colours the night with couture, sound in two parts: SoScandal! by Jean Paul Gaultier. It’s perfectly clear, and it sounds like a champagne cork explosion.\"\n\nSo Scandal! is available as a 30, 50 and 80ml Eau de Parfum.",

Top notes are Cinnamon, Lavender, Coriander, Mandarin Orange, Lime, Bergamot and Grapefruit; middle notes are Myrhh, Nutmeg, Carnation, Brazilian Rosewood, Pine Tree, Sage, Jasmine and Red Berries; base notes are Amber, Vanilla, Sandalwood, Musk, Patchouli and Vetiver.\n\nA fresh citrus explosion at the top notes (tangerine, grapefruit, lime and bergamot) is harmonized with a floral sharpness of lavender, nut, spiced notes of coriander and warm cinnamon. Carnation (along with jasmine, rose tree and pine) is restrained with warm patchouli, sandalwood, vetiver, benzoin, vanilla and amber. Subtle aroma of red berries enforces the structure, adding sensuousness and characteristic to the perfume. The creator of this fragrance is Bob Slattery, and the bottle designer is Pierre Dinand. Obsession for Men was launched in 1986, a year after the female version. This fragrance pair belongs to one of the most popular ones in the 80s. In 2005, their nighttime heir was presented: Obsession Night. Obsession for Men is the 1987 FiFi award winner. See the article about Calvin Klein on fragrantica.",

    "description": "To Be Tattooart by Police is a Floral Fruity Gourmand fragrance for women. To Be Tattooart was launched in 2017. Top notes are Maple syrup, Apple Blossom, Plum and Freesia; middle notes are Sweet Notes, Heliotrope, Violet, Wild Rose and Jasmine; base notes are Marshmallow, Musk, Sandalwood and Cedar.\n\n\"To Be Tattooart is a young and trendy concept for a perfume that conveys freedom and strong personality. This new launch represents a theme with great sensitivity amongst young people: the tattoo, that is flaunted as a contemporary language, an extension of their personality, an indelible symbol on their body which expresses the real identity of the wearer. The rose is considered the queen of tattoos. It celebrates beauty, passion and the mystery of life. Voluptuous old-style roses enhance the pink bottle for her and blue bottle for him. The decoration covers the whole skull making it even more fascinating and eye-catching. The opaque finishing simulates the effect of the tattoo on the skin. The blue rose for him represents the challenge, for a man who does not take “no” for an answer, not even from himself. Eternal love and passion are the meanings of the red rose for her.\n\nThis fragrance is the synthesis of modern femininity and seductive power. It opens with transparent apple blossom, fruity plum, and delicious maple syrup. Intensive jasmine combined with candied violet and wild rose are complemented by piquant freesia to a tender bouquet. Soft musk accords are surrounded by creamy sandalwood and a powdery-sweet marshmallow accord in the base.\" - a note from the brand.",

    "description": "To Be by Police is a Woody Spicy fragrance for men. To Be was launched in 2011. Top notes are Grapefruit and Pepper; middle note is Violet Leaf; base notes are Amber, Virginia Cedar and Patchouli.\n\nPolice presents a new fragrance for men in 2011 and adds it to its fragrant offer. The fragrance is To Be, available in a glass scull with a metal Police plate as a detail.\n\nThe new Police flacon could be inspired by mysterious crystal scull that has been impressing archaeologists and anthropologists for years; or be the perfect accessory to Johnny Deep in the role of captain Jack Sparrow (Pirates of the Caribbean). One thing is for sure: the new flacon is interesting and attracts attention of all fans of fragrance and collectors of flacons, with a game of light and shadow.\n\nName of the fragrance reminds us of Hamlet's thought \"To be or not to be, that is the question\" depicted in a modern, masculine and rebellious way. Photographer of advertising campaign is Polack Andrzej Dragan, who cooperated with Mavive and exhibited photos at Fondazione Museo Minguzzi Via Palermo 11, in Milan.\n\nAs for compositions, we can guess a dose of adventure accompanying flacon design. Black pepper dictates characteristic spicy accords in the beginning refreshed with cold and luminous grapefruit. A fresh wave of violet leaves gives a fine, elegant note to the new Police edition. A base of the composition incorporates woody notes of cedar and patchouli along with a fine trail of white amber.\n\nThe new fragrance by Police, To Be, has been available as 75ml EDT, since spring 2011.",

The top notes hit us with the freshness of mandarin intermingled with the bold scent of neroli, to melt into notes of lavender, jasmine and white dahlia. The free, contemporary femininity of this new Trussardi women's scent is enhanced by the hypnotic and velvety base notes of a violet, patchouli and suede accord. The perfectly cylindrical bottle is decorated by glossy painted stripes in matte pink, black and white, with a golden metal lid, and is set to become a real piece of Italian design.\n\nThe fragrance is available as a 30ml, 60ml and 90ml Eau de Parfum.",

The composition of this perfume is delightful and of high quality, just like Trussardi leather belt or portmone. Aromatic, masculine notes of lavender, basil and spruce are in the top, and they lead to the heart of the fragrance which is more spicy that floral: note of rose is followed by bay leaf, cinnamon and carnation. The sharp masculine base is made of patchouli, labdanum, Tonka bean and, of course, leather. The perfume was created by Beatrice Piquet in 1983, and the bottle was designed by Nicola Trussardi.",

    "description": "Legend by Montblanc is a Aromatic Fougere fragrance for men. Legend was launched in 2011. Legend was created by Olivier Pescheux and Celine Perdriel. Top notes are Lavender, Pineapple, Bergamot and Lemon Verbena; middle notes are Red Apple, Dried Fruits, oak moss, Geranium, Coumarin and Rose; base notes are Tonka Bean and Sandalwood.\n\nThe brand Mont Blanc presents a new men's fragrance in April 2011. Legend is dedicated to inspiring, virtuous and self-confident men who are courageous, passionate and authentic. Their fragrance is subtle but striking and masculine.\n\nOlivier Pescheux, the perfumer behind this fresh fougere creation, tried to make the fragrance filled with contrasts, combining notes that evoke strength and tenderness, tradition and modernity. The composition opens with fresh aromatic tones of bergamot, lavender, pineapple leaf and exotic verbena (Litsea Cubeba). The heart emphasizes oakmoss note (evernyl molecule) merged with geranium, coumarin, apple, rose, and Pomarosa molecule (notes of dried fruit). The base contains sandalwood, tonka and evernyl.\n\nHeavy and slightly curved bottle of black and metallic colors is inspired by the famous Meisterstück pen design, made of glass and metal. The design is minimalistic and luxurious, perfect for the concept behind this fragrance. The black and white campaign features Simon Clark photographed by Peter Lindbergh.\n\nLegend is available as 30, 50 and 100 ml Eau de Toilette.",

    "description": "Acqua di Parma Colonia by Acqua di Parma is a Citrus fragrance for women and men. Acqua di Parma Colonia was launched in 1916.\n\nAcqua di Parma started as a small factory in Parma. The first fragrance was created in 1916, Colonia, and at the beginning it was used to perfume gentlemen\\'s handkerchiefs. Colonia became a real symbol of Italian chic among American and European celebrities in the pre-war (1930\\'s) and post-war (1950\\'s) years. Cary Grant and David Niven, Ava Gadner and Eva Turner, later joined by Audrey Hepburn, were among the passionate admirers of Colonia. From a small factory, Acqua di Parma grew into a prominent house with wide range distribution.\n\nAcqua Di Parma Colonia was presented as a citrus fragrance. It was composed of lavender, rosemary, Sicilian citrus, Bulgarian rose, jasmine, amber and light musk.\n\nThe bottle is simple but elegant, charming in the Italian way. It comes as 180ml bath oil and Eau de Parfum.\n\nThere is another version of this fragrance, the limited edition for 2007, named Colonia Edizione Murano. The bottle is made of Murano glass, beautiful and elegant, designed by Giorgio Vigna.\n\nRead more about this fragrance in the article on the prestige Italian house Acqua di Parma.",

    "description": "Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile by Acqua di Parma is a Floral Woody Musk fragrance for women. Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile was launched in 2006. Acqua di Parma Iris Nobile was created by Francoise Caron and Francis Kurkdjian. Top notes are Iris, Star Anise, Bergamot, Mandarin Orange and Orange; middle notes are Tuberose, Orange Blossom, Mimosa, Ylang-Ylang, Hibiscus and Cedar; base notes are Vanilla and Amber.\n\nAqua di Parma, experienced in production of chic fragrances very popular in high society, has denoted its renaissance with, among other things, eau de toilette Iris Nobile. The new EDT has perfectly fit into the company of renowned fragrances such as Aqua di Parma Colonia (1916) and Profumo (1930), with relaunch of which Aqua di Parma has entered the new millennium and turned over a new sheet in its history.\n\nIris Nobile was created in 2004 by reputable master perfumers – Francoise Caron and Francis Kurkdjian. It was first created as eau de toilette. Classically elegant and feminine delicate floral fragrance is opposing the briskly-aromatic Italian style of the house; however, its moderate rhythm reveals the ambitions of beautiful floral fragrances of the past century.\n\nIris Nobile opens with luminous fresh citrusy notes of orange, mandarin and bergamot, followed by anise. The beauty of the iris flower is accentuated by the whole floral chorus of orange blossom, ylang-ylang, tuberose, mimosa and woodsy cedar nuance in the heart, among which the orange blossom is the most persistent companion. The floral bouquet only accompanies, and not at all overlays the beautiful iris solo – delicate-retro-romantic, with a trace of aery powder.\n\nEau de Parfum Iris Nobile was created in 2006. Besides the general resemblance, the fragrance has become deeper and more intensive, a bit darker and slightly sweeter. The citruses, so dominant in the original, have now been given a marginal role – the focus is on iris, and it has become more accentuated. Besides amber and vanilla, the base now includes oakmoss and patchouli that bring in a dramatic chypre note. EDT was launched as a summer fragrance, while EDP makes a great match to fur.",

Top notes are Mandarin Orange, Bergamot and Pepper; middle notes are Rose, Peony, Violet and Lily-of-the-Valley; base notes are Musk, Cedar and Ambergris.\n\nThe Nobile collection by the Italian house of Acqua di Parma presented a new fragrance dedicated to rose flower. Acqua di Parma Rosa Nobile complements the luxurious, sophisticated and very elegant collection of fragrances among which are Iris Nobile, Magnolia Nobile and Gelsomino Nobile inspired to iris, magnolia and jasmine.\n\nBy following the Italian collection and selecting the best ingredients to represent the style of the brand, leaders of the house of Acqua di Parma selected a special sort of Centifolia rose, which grows and blooms only in Italy, to be the inspiration behind the new perfume. The composition of the fragrance ROSA NOBILE opens with a luminous, juicy, Italian-style signature of bergamot and mandarin, illuminating the floral heart with their notes, spiced with a pinch of black pepper. Citruses and tart notes of pepper lead us to Italian rose which has the main role in the composition, enriched with lily of the valley, velvety violet and gentle peony. The base incorporates dry, sophisticated woodsy notes of cedar and ambergris, surrounded with sensual musk.\n\nThe special sort of Centifolia rose selected as the ingredient of Rosa Nobile grows in the rose garden in Piedmont, on a limited organic plantation near the city of Alba. Buds of this sort are hand-picked at early dawn while the garden is still dewy. The picking lasts 40 days in May and June when the scent reaches its peak and is the most intense.\n\nThe new perfume ROSA NOBILE arrives in the characteristic flacon form like the previous Nobile editions, but its fluid is in a warm pink shade this time. The fragrance is available as 50 and 100 ml Eau de Parfum, accompanied by perfumed body care products.",

A heart incorporates floral notes of tulip, while a base finishes with greenery, blond wood and vetiver. The fragrance can be purchased as 100ml edp.\n\nLa Tulipe is built around the idea of the tulip - a flower reminiscent of morning moist gardens and by being one of the season's first flowers to open its bud; the tulip has become a symbol for the rebirth of spring.\n\n\"I have always loved tulips and decided to create a fragrance that spoke of the whole idea of the flower.  To do this I wanted to capture its shy characteristic - and combine that with the expressive physicality it bears.\"  – Ben Gorham",

I hope that people read the label and identify with that sentiment in its simplest form, and then find something deeper to relate to: the juxtaposition between the familiar and the unfamiliar.\"\n- Ben Gorham, founder and creative director of Byredo.\n\nDrawing on Byredo’s philosophy of translating fragmented memories and abstract ideas into scents, the new edition Mixed Emotions represents an olfactory sketch of our current, collective state of mind.\n\nComfortable notes of maté tea and the sharp sweetness of black currant lead to the heart of soothing Ceylon tea and the petite accord of violet leaves. The wood base provides “comfort” with notes of papyrus and birch.\n\nMixed Emotions is available in 50 and 100 ml Eau de Parfum.",

Top notes are Limoncello, Incense and Cardamom; middle notes are Agarwood (Oud), Patchouli, Papyrus and Brazilian Rosewood; base notes are oak moss and Tobacco.\n\nOud possesses a great cultural significance because of its use in traditional incense and perfumes, and it is also mentioned in one of the world's oldest written texts - the Sanskrit Vedas from India. When the once light Aquilaria tree heartwood becomes infected with a specific type of mold, it defends itself with a dark and fragrant protective resin. This now dark wood, oud or agarwood, holds a complex fragrance, resembling few or no other natural ingredients.\n\nOud Immortel is a chypre woody fragrance that merges patchouli and papyrus so the whole composition has a smoky character. Tobacco leaf and moss contribute to the depth and complexity of oud, while rosewood and incense cause the elegant silage on skin.\n\nIts is available as Eau de Parfum in 50 ml and 100 ml bottles.",

Top note is Cognac; middle notes are Cinnamon, Tonka Bean, Oak and Hedione; base notes are Vanilla, Praline, Sandalwood and Candied Almond.\n\n\"Introducing a new olfactive family, Kilian Hennessy pays tribute to his heritage, as heir to the renowned French cognac-making family, and to his choice olfactory intoxicants for driving the night towards dawn.\n\nA first-time collaboration with French perfumer Benoit Lapouza, the perfume Angel's Share is Kilian Hennessy's most personal fragrance creation yet, inspired by his eighth-generation inheritance of Hennessy savoir-faire in cognac making. The perfume goes deep into the cellars of founder's mind and memory, and into its most mysterious dimension: \"la part des anges\" or \"angels' share\"— an evaporation of liquor in oak barrels that lifts, while aging, like a silent offering to the gods.\n\nMuch like a Master Perfumer who crafts accords and essences in a perfume, a Master Blender combines the eaux-de-vie in perfect proportions for an exceptional cognac. Angels' Share contains the essence of Cognac derived from the liquor to lend it a natural caramel color. Opening with cognac oil, upon a blend of oak absolute, cinnamon essence and Tonka bean absolute, the scent's long-lasting notes of sandalwood, praline and vanilla make for a delicious finish, a rare concoction only angels should experience.\"\n\nNotes: Cognac, Tonka Bean and Oak wood.",

As a first-time collaboration with perfumer Franck Voelkl, Kilian Hennessy wanted to recreate the tasting of \"gin on the rocks\" with a splash of lime.\n\nThe Perfume: Anyone for notes of gin, distilled with rose and cucumber? The perfume Roses on Ice opens with the aquatic freshness of cucumber and the aromatic uplift of juniper berries, creating an icy sensation, rounded in an accord with voluptuous Rose Centifolia. Upon a drydown of sandalwood and musk, the scent expresses the sharp—yet deeply infused—character of gin consumed in its ideal.\n\nPerfume notes: Cucumber, Juniper Berries and Rose.\"",

    "description": "Cruz del Sur II by Xerjoff is a Woody Floral Musk fragrance for women and men. Cruz del Sur II was launched in 2017. Top notes are Mango, Guava, Pineapple and Apple Blossom; middle notes are Black Currant, Exotic floral notes and Violet Leaf; base notes are Milk, Dried Fruits, Musk, Vetiver and Cedar.\n\nThe skin avidly soaks up the humours, luxuriantly moistened by tiny streams following the winding trails of mango, pineapple, guava, apple blossoms. Among millions of creatures, the most radiant is the one whose appearance is uncontaminated like a Yanomami tribe, its heart a bouquet of exotic flowers, about to carry as a gift to the stone altar its scents of blackcurrant and green leaves, as far as they can go.\n\nThe eager search of mankind for every kind of gold, whether yellow, white or black, has not deprived this creature of its natural charm. The animal and vegetable worlds clash under the gracious auspices of the vetiver and the cedar, which responds to the milky notes like a distant drum. Screams bounce back from the tree trunks, accompanied by candied fruits and soft musk. The greatest green space on Earth deserves such an inspiration. It is time to take flight, like a butterfly of a species not yet classified.\n\nCruz del Sur II is available from September 2017 in 50ml Eau de Parfum flacons.",

A powerful combination of a sharp, aromatic top note of Grapefruit entwined around a heart made of deep and leathery Labdanum, the Spicy floral aroma of Carnation accent, and hints of Mayflower. Smothering and suave base notes of Sandalwood, Vetiver, Celery Seeds, Black and Pink Pepper, Galbanum, Nutmeg, Guaiac, Wood, Oakmoss, and Cedar fairly ooze a pleasant struggle between power and passion.\n\nTop Notes: Grapefruit.\nHeart Notes: Mayflower, Carnation, Labdanum\nBase Notes: Sandalwood, Vetiver, Celery Seeds, Black and Pink Pepper, Galbanum, Nutmeg, Guaiac Wood, Oakmoss, Cedar",

Top note is Nutmeg; middle notes are Iris and Milk; base notes are Sandalwood, Musk and Vanilla.\n\nPerfumer Antoine Maisondieu explores the unique properties of Sandalwood Album from Australia. His idea was to mix contemporary Parisian inspirations with the mystical energy of this ingredient to create a bright and soothing scent that leads to an ultimate addiction.\n\nAs a captivating spell for the skin and for the soul, he created SANTAL CALLING, subtly mixing delicate Musks with an irresistible Milky accord. The smooth essence of Sandalwood is then curled up in an intense Vanilla Bourbon from Madagascar, for a mesmerizing sillage.",

This extrait represents a deeper, more immersive take on the original, designed to evoke a heightened emotional response through a denser and more luxurious composition. Developed in close collaboration with master perfumer Jordi Fernández, who worked with EX NIHILO for over five years, Blue Talisman Extrait explores new dimensions while remaining connected to the spirit of the original. Where the Eau de Parfum focused on citrus, amber, and woods, the extrait version pivots toward a fruitier and more floral orientation, anchored by a rich, ambery base.\n\nAvailable in bottles of 50ml and 100ml.",

Top notes are Iris, Mandarin Orange, Bergamot and Pink Pepper; middle notes are Tuberose, Lily, Ylang-Ylang, Orange Blossom, Lily-of-the-Valley and Rose; base notes are White Musk, Patchouli, Benzoin, Vanilla and Amber.\n\nMurano Exclusive Collection represents the ideal combination of the highest Venetian craftsmanship with the most refined fragrances created by master perfumers. The collection is now enriched with a new fragrance: Imperial Emerald.\n\nEmerald-coloured eyes, the whoosh of a regal garment and the unmistakable scent of timeless elegance: Imperial Emerald is the new seductive fragrance by The Merchant of Venice and takes its inspiration from the peacock, the most enchanting and majestic of creatures. For millennia this bird has inspired myths and legends in both western and eastern cultures, legends that attributed to it the most sublime meanings: beauty, longevity and love, along with vanity, luxury and pride. The dazzling, visual displays generated by its fan-like tail have enchanted and confused the gaze of mortals, as well as the immortals of countless myths. To pay homage to the elegance and wonder of Venice, The Merchant of Venice was inspired by these emerald-green and blue patterns and created this new olfactory masterpiece. The Murano Exclusive line distinguishes itself by its olfactory refinement and high content of essential oils, which generate a long-lasting scented trail.\n\nThe top is joyful, with splendid modern citrus faceting the fragrance from the top to the dry-down as a caressing shiver to accompany an orris poudrè and pink pepper in a passionate crescendo. In the middle a loving tremble, ylang ylang and opulent rose absolute Chile, is joined by a marvelous bouquet of clinking lily of the valley with all the magnificence of night-blooming jasmine, tuberose and orange flowers. The dry-down is warm and rich of white amber and precious benzoin passionately hugged in a seductive dance. A creamy vanilla and the most enveloping musks accompany an innovative patchouli for an unforgettable longlasting trail, for a woman who leaves her mark and is, like her Imperial Emerald, forever.\n\nMurano Exclusive is composed by seven exclusive Eau de Parfums Concentrée fragrances: Imperial Emerald, Crequelè, Arabesque, Liberty, Vinegia, Rococò and Fenicia. Each one is characterized by a high concentration of fragrance each with its own olfactory signature expertly crafted: the floral and oriental heart notes confer a unique, refined, and definite character to each creation.\n\nTop: Bergamot, Mandarin, Pink Pepper, Iris\nHeart: Ylang Ylang, Rose Absolute, Absolute Lily, Lily of the Valley, Tuberose, Orange Flowers\nBase: Oriental, Vanilla, Benzoin, White Musk, Patchouli\n\nImperial Emerald is available as a 100ml Eau de Parfum Concentree from June 2019.",

Its formula evokes the delicate and pure skin of a woman in all its beauty.\n\n“One of the biggest challenges was to create a fragrance that is fresh and delicate, but at the same time very powerful and expressive. Valaya is reminiscent of the feel of cotton against the skin. A cocoon-like perfume that is sensual and elegant at the same time. A white perfume full of contrasts that is delicate yet incredibly alluring.” – Julien Sprecher (brand creator)",

Top notes are Cardamom, Geranium and Pink Pepper; middle notes are Patchouli, Cinnamon and Rose; base notes are Leather, Oud and Amber.\n\nInspired by the African continent, this fragrance unveils warm spicy notes of cardamom and saffron over a floral touch of geranium, which mingle with a leather accord to give life to an exceptional wild leather.\n\nSouth Africa is where geranium first grew in the wild, and its presence in African Leather is a nod to its origins. Sustainably cultivated in Egypt, this particular geranium has a floral, aromatic and green character that encounters hand-picked Guatemalan cardamom, a spice with green, fruity, almost-candied accents that was used as incense in Ancient Egyptian times.",

Inspired by the hypnotic energy of China and its imperial palaces, the first impression is of fresh bergamot and oil of orange that bring a sheer and invigorating power.\n\nThe awakening of the dragon, imperial. Eyes sparkling with icy fire. Oil of orange. He rises above my cup of red tea, his breath swirling the flavor of bergamot. His trembling shadow stretches out to my place in the hall of honor. Suddenly the heat swells, and the atmosphere shifts from citrus to intense wood. Soaring into the air, he vanishes from the palace in a flash of powder. What is he looking for? All of a sudden, it stops snowing outside. I can see him in the distance, undulating in sync with the Great Wall of China. The dragon is dancing with joy, drunk on freedom. He sows an everlasting spring, maté tea, grapefruit, and yet leaves a wake of passionate amber and vanilla. Winter Palace has freed its emissary, a winged and tenacious dragon king with a trail of fire.",

The heart of an absolute orange. The lace of an azulejo, the spiral of a hidden staircase, petitgrain after petitgrain after petitgrain...Welcoming visions everywhere.

    "description": "Madurai by Memo Paris is a Floral fragrance for women and men. Madurai was launched in 2022. The nose behind this fragrance is Gaël Montero.\n\nLegend has it that Madurai, a sacred city in southern India, derived its name from the drops of divine nectar that fell from Lord Shiva's hair. A spectacular world created from a drop of perfume?! Pure olfactory genius. Absolute of Indian jasmine sambac, oil of fresh Indian turmeric, here lies the Hindu temple of Meenakshi. Absolute of jasmine from Upper Egypt, its pyramidal towers home to all spirits. Australian sandalwood, the statues begin to dance and swayas the wind sings its song. Oil of marigold from the Indian Ocean, mythological creatures in fits of laughter. Clary sage from France, the colours speak a close language. Spirit of peach, bewitching Madurai erupts in thunderous applause for the beauty of jasmine. Eyes wide open, breathe in this floral and fruity whirlwind that exudes incredible charm.\n\nA memory of India, steeped in the rich and airy fragrance of jasmine sambac and the creamier scent of sandalwood, is what guided the composition of Madurai. A fragrance that stirs the senses with vibrant notes of citrus and turmeric, like a colourful market stall.\n\nAbout the flacon: The plate of Madurai is inspired by the hypnotic motifs that can be found on the ceiling of the temple.\n\nQuote from the perfumer: \"I created Madurai thinking about a wonderful trip to South India a few years ago. I remember one morning, sitting on a small terrace drinking tea. All my senses were alert. In the warm air, the intoxicating perfume of the flower sellers; the power of the spices, and the sweetness of the mangoes from the stalls…. The rich and airy jasmine sambac of the offering necklaces and the creamy scent of sandalwood around the temples.\" / Gaël Montero\n\nNOTES: Turmeric Essence, Sambac Jasmine, Absolute Peach, Italian Bergamot Oil, Clary sage Oil, Indian Tuberose Absolute, Egyptian Jasmine Absolute, Tagete Oil from Madagascar, Australian Sandalwood Oil, Suede Accord.\n\nTwo exceptional jasmines illuminate Madurai: jasmine sambac is harvested in southern India between the months of April and October, before the monsoon period, to obtain an optimal, intensely floral quality with a fruity, green facet. The jasmine from Upper Egypt is sourced from the upstream section of the Nile for a unique 'terroir' effect, and a warm, rich fragrance of petals. They blend harmoniously with the velvety quality of spirit of peach derived from an exclusive process that recovers the fruit pulp from pressing peaches for juice and extracts the olfactory components to yield a natural extract that is akin to smelling and tasting a fresh peach.",

This is an eau de parfum that prolongs the dream of drifting on fragrant waters made of notes of Jasmine, Mate and Osmanthus.\n\nOsmanthus is largely native to China, where its flowers are harvested by hand and kept in salt water with pieces of oak to obtain an absolute with milkier facets not revealed by the fresh flowers. Its fruity quality tinged with leather sways alongside the herbaceous maté absolute with floral facets of mimosa and jasmine sambac absolute whose fresh blossoms are hand-picked in India and then immediately processed to retain all of their delicate and voluptuous qualities.",

The composition is unique and bears witness to an ongoing desire for creation. This fresh, intense and leathery eau de parfum is the result of a harmonious combination of green tea, jasmine absolute and leather.\n\nThis organic jasmine is produced by an esteemed family of Egyptian growers, and yields a sophisticated oil that discreetly dispels the overly green top notes and overly animal base notes.

Lose yourself, let the journey of this vagabond seed be your guide.\n\nThe jasmine known as Sambac comes from the Sanskrit word 'campaka', which means heady perfume and offers an initial clue to its character. Its fresh blossoms are harvested by hand in India, where the plant is revered, at the break of dawn when the buds are still closed.

Top notes are Ylang-Ylang and Bergamot; middle notes are Heliotrope, Hedione and Bulgarian Rose; base notes are Myrrh and Sandalwood.\n\n\"The signature of this narcotic bomb lies in three essential ingredients: rose, hedione and heliotropin.\nWhile hedione activates the brain regions linked to pleasure and the libido, heliotropin goes even further.\nEqually tender and illicit, this crystalline powder hides its intentions well. \nBeware of its creamy, powdery and floral facets, wavering between vanilla and almond!\nUsed in over doses, heliotropin becomes a psychoactive substance. A forbidden shiver rushes over the skin. \nA substance under strict regulations.\nIts possession is strictly controlled by law, because heliotropin is used for the chemical synthesis of mda, a prohibited drug and substitute for ecstasy.\nConfronted with this diabolical indulgence, no one is safe from an olfactory obsession that can soon become a real addiction!\" - a note from the brand.",

Top notes are Cypress Leaf, Saffron, Cardamom, Artemisia, Bergamot and Grapefruit; middle notes are Bulgarian Rose, Nutmeg and Jasmine; base notes are Agarwood (Oud), Cedar, Leather, Sandalwood, Amber, Tonka Bean, Vanilla and Musk.\n\nPenhaligon`s London presents a new fragrance of their rich collection which is inspired by precious goods traded by Turkey—exotic flowers, spices, soft leather and precious materials. The fragrance was named after a small Turkish village, Halfeti, where charming Halfeti black roses bloom on the coasts of the Euphrates river. \"These dark and mysterious roses are very rare and are result of unique ecological conditions in which they are grown.\"\n\nHalfeti is an extremely rich woody-floral fragrance whose composition is signed by perfumer Christian Provenzano. The perfume opens with a rich union of citruses, herbs and spices while blending bergamot and grapefruit with saffron, cardamom, atermisia and cypress needles. The heart develops floral notes of jasmine and Bulgarian rose combined with shades of nutmeg, while the base introduces warm aromas of leather, precious oud, cedar, sandalwood, amber, musk, tonka and vanilla.\n\nPenhaligon's Halfeti arrives in the characteristic bottle form, available as 100 ml Eau de Parfum. The fragrance is available on the official website of Penhaligon's.",

    "description": "Kirkè by Tiziana Terenzi is a Chypre Fruity fragrance for women and men. Kirkè was launched in 2015. The nose behind this fragrance is Paolo Terenzi. Top notes are Passionfruit, Peach, Pear, Raspberry, Cassis and Sand; middle note is Lily-of-the-Valley; base notes are Musk, Sandalwood, Vanilla, Patchouli and Heliotrope.\n\nAn enchanting place is found just south of Rome. Today it is a Natural Park, but it is still characterised by a landscape so rich it takes the traveller's breath away. This place is fixed in memories and has thousands of facets. It is immersed among the enormous sand dunes that face the sea and uninhabited mountains that are surrounded by opulent forests and woods. Framing the area is the most flourishing Mediterranean scrub ever seen that holds traces of the great men and women who lived here in the past. Walking along the ancient paths means being immersed in the sinuous scents and resounding recollections in memory, like a mermaid's song or the melody that the goddess Circe used to attract her victims, which we learned about in the Odyssey by Ulysses. We too have been enraptured by these persuasive perfumes, so much so that we have captured them in a sensual and warm fragrance that can transport the soul to the beauties of the senses. This is a magical and sensual perfume that is like the goddess that inspired it. It is characterised by a lush bouquet of sweet fruit including Passion Fruit, Peaches and Pears, mixed through skilful alchemy with Raspberries and Cassis. It is persuasive like a caress of Lily of the Valley and like a barefoot stroll on sand that is warmed by the contrast with the unmistakable Heliotropine and made powerful through the strength of the Patchouli and Musk wood. Like one of the famous enchanted potions of Goddess Circe, this extract enraptures whoever wears it, guiding them on mysterious paths to discover amazing marvels in a precarious evolution of emotions and inspiration enclosed in a magic filter that is able to leave behind an unending wake of mystery and sensuality.",

    "description": "Delox by Tiziana Terenzi is a Floral Woody Musk fragrance for women and men. Delox was launched in 2017. The nose behind this fragrance is Paolo Terenzi. Top notes are Coffee, Iris and White Hyacinth; middle notes are Turkish Rose, Vanilla and Opoponax; base notes are Honey, White Musk, Amber and Cedar.\n\n\"This creation is inspired by the journey by sailing boat around the Cyclades islands of the Greek archipelago and its bouquet contains all the colors and flavors of the most genuine and southernmost Mediterranean. The essence of summer, without a care in the world, and full of inebriating scents blown into the area by the “Meltemi” (typical wind of these latitudes), with its warm, sensual embrace, is magically contained in this fragrance inspired by the unspoiled, ancestral beauty of the Mediterranean. The strong aroma of coffee, made in an ancient “moka” (typical coffee-making machine) floats through the crisp morning air, penetrated by the iridescent light reflected in the sea. The gaze immediately hurtles towards that infinite blue, framed by plants and flowers with a strong scent, made even sweeter and more mellow by the faraway reverberation of scents of honey and sweet amber resin. Precious essences jealously guarded in ultra-fine glass bottles, which recall the ancient splendors of the island, still there in the form of its famous ruins of the temples of Apollo where Ulysses landed during his epic adventures. The hypnotic force of white hyacinth, combined with the opulence of royal iris and ecstasy rose, surrenders itself to the embrace of sweet myrrh and roasted coffee, against a fine background of amber and cypress notes, mellowed by hints of honey. The entire combination is enhanced by the strong hint of Lebanese cedar wood. How wonderful it is to awaken, wrapped in the wonder of discovery, retracing our past in order to see a clearer reflection of our future!\" - a note from the brand.\n\nDelox by Tiziana Terenzi is a Floral Woody Musk fragrance for women and men.

Top notes are Oak, Black Currant, Ylang-Ylang, Jasmine and Bergamot; middle notes are Honey, Agarwood (Oud), Persimmon, Cumin, Iris and Angelica; base notes are Patchouli, Cacao, Amber, Sandalwood, Palisander Rosewood and Labdanum.\n\nThe other stop on this wonderful journey is in Tuscany: the perhaps less romantic and less well-known hills and valleys of Maremma. Tough and strong, just like the men and women who live there; regal and proud as the horses that gallop tirelessly across its landscape; it is a place for camping in the pristine wilderness alongside the Buttero and their amazing horses. The term Buttero refers to Maremma’s horseback herders. The name comes from the Greek boútoros (= oxen herder). Taken broadly, this term could be considered the Italian equivalent to the American Cowboy. This complex and multi-faceted perfume exudes the power of this place. Filled with fruity and floral notes native to the Maremma landscape together with strong leather and wood tones makes this perfume incredibly long lasting. Its black bottle contains all the charm of this wild and fascinating land, one of the least well-known corners of Italy, yet one brimming with wonders.\n\nTop Notes: Bitter Bergamot, Ylang-Ylang, Jasmine, Black Currant, Holm Oak Acorn\n\nMiddle Notes: Angelica, Orris Root, Agarwood, Lotus Wood, Cumin, Honey\n\nBase Notes: Patchouli, Cocoa Powder, Sandalwood, Cistus Labdanum, Oriental Crystals, Rosewood.",

    "description": "Porpora by Tiziana Terenzi is a Oriental Floral fragrance for women and men. Porpora was launched in 2017. The nose behind this fragrance is Paolo Terenzi. Top notes are Rose, Raspberry, Cloves and Cinnamon; middle notes are Bulgarian Rose, Incense, Patchouli and Poppy; base notes are Myrrh, Amber, Musk, Benzoin and Chestnut.\n\n\"The stylistic pathway of the Moon Collection continues in its many forms, geared to explore confines never reached before in the art of perfume-making, driving us in this dreamlike journey towards cosmic spaces that are ever more mysterious and secret Porpora is the name of the work contained in this precious passion red bottle, decorated with a gilded jewel-shaped cap and depicting the lunar phases with fine lacquers in fiery red. The creation is inspired by the magnificence of the famous Red Moon which sometimes leaps out, in a sudden fiery ball of light, from behind the horizon. Perhaps the most magical and mysterious image of this long trip down memory lane, made by the child in us as we reflect on the most peaceful, carefree period of our lives. Alarm, enthrallment, excitement and wonder when faced with so much magnificence are all enclosed in this precious creation, which opens with a bold top note provided by the Rose Absolute, surrounded by wild forest raspberries and spices, such as cinnamon and cloves. The bouquet of top notes then settles on an irreverent, brave heart, almost throwing all caution to the wind, thanks to an innovative intertwining of the sensual seductive power of Bulgarian Rose and the hypnotic effect of Poppy, contrasted by the mystical strength of incense and patchouli. This fine creation is sustained and characterized to ensure an extraordinary persistence on the skin, by the power of the chestnut wood, amalgamated with resins of Benjamin and Myrrh and enhanced by the mild strength of the precious blend of Oriental & Musk, kept safe for more than thirty years by the Terenzi Family. The olfactory seal for a unique, rare essence.\" - a note from the brand.\n\nPorpora by Tiziana Terenzi is a Oriental Floral fragrance for women and men. This is a new fragrance.

Top notes are Spruce, Pine Tree and Pebbles; middle notes are Incense, Rose, Patchouli and Violet; base notes are Soil Tincture, Woody Notes, Amber, Labdanum, Sandalwood and Tonka Bean.\n\nThe house of Tiziana Terenzi, known for its scented candles, presents its first Extrait de Parfum line in 2012. The line is inspired by fire with four different experiences of journey. “The hypnotic power and beauty of fire are always present in our lives, connecting us with great symbolic power to our emotions and to all of creation. The four new perfumes embody the four stages of a journey consumed by fire. In fire, every emotion, every image, every fragrance comes to life and exists almost independently from our thoughts. Our perfumes capture the indomitable spirit of our emotions. The creation of these perfume essences comes from the never-ending quest to depict and capture emotions. These perfumes embody the powerful Faustian desire to try to hold on to a beautiful moment, and the constant exploration of the “self and the non-self”. The fragrances are named XIX March, Ecstasy, Gold Rose Oudh and White Fire. The ones that have “black soul” are Gold Rose Oudh and White Fire and are labeled with leather label, while the ones with “white soul”, labeled with wood, are XIX March and Ecstasy.\n\nEcstasy is a mystical fragrance of “the most intense journey into the “sacred fire” of the soul, in search of total authentic in the suspended gravity of absolute beauty.”\n\nTop notes: pine, spruce, stone powder. Heart: incense, patchouli, rose, violet. Base: sandalwood, amber, cistrose, tonka, forest land, ancient wood.\n\nIt is available as 100 ml Extrait de Parfum.",

A scent of wild and lush nature, both sweet and warm at the same time, emphasised by the intense smell of melted caramel that comes from small camps at the foot of the mountain, where we rest before the climb. This fragrance reverberates in the air and is reflected in the blue of the sea, passing by the ruins of the ancient city to reach the lighthouse at Cape Gelidonya, which stands alone in a place full of history and legends. The tensions and attractions of this combination of elements, fire and water, have been captured and enclosed in a perfume extract made from rare and precious natural raw materials. This untouched territory, rugged and wild, gathers within itself all the splendour and strength of the Mediterranean that from its belly, like an ancient Greek deity, breathes supernatural and magical fire giving rise to Chimera.\n\nTOP NOTES: Black pepper, Lemon, Saffron, Red Earth, White Leather, Hydrogen, Tolu Balm, Thyme, Bay Leaf\nMIDDLE NOTES: Irid, pimiento/red pepper, Carnation flower, Peony, Perfect flower, Honey, Black Magnolia, Sage, Incense\nBASE NOTES: Patchouli, Cashmere, Cyst Labdanum, Benjamin, Caramel, Agarwood, Tobacco, Copaiba Balsam, Leather, Pine Wood",

    "description": "Gumin by Tiziana Terenzi is a fragrance for women and men. Gumin was launched in 2016. The nose behind this fragrance is Paolo Terenzi. Top notes are Mandarin Orange, Orange, Pineapple and Bergamot; middle notes are Ozonic notes, Amber, Violet, Jasmine and Rose; base notes are Musk, Sandalwood, Birch and Agarwood (Oud).\n\nThis fragrance is dedicated to Guglielmo, the founder and pillar of our artisan perfumery, which from generation to generation continues his journey in search of wonder. The most noble and timeless fragrance of the collection. The most magical and powerful essence in the reverberation of his memory. When we were children, his scent echoed in the air, his strong presence announced festive days and the euphoria of celebrations. The powerful tranquillity of his hand as he led us safely around the fire of the kitchen bright with cakes and sweets or of the crackling focarina bonfire in the wood. A perfume that speaks of glittering love, of reassuring tenderness, of a joyful eve that preannounces the greatest celebration in the world: that of life. An extract dedicated to those who like to distinguish themselves with style that is understated but clear-cut, unique but elegant, powerful but not egocentric. A perfume that opens with rich harmonies of citrus fruits from the sunniest of Italian orchards. Mandarin and bergamot thus blend with Sicilian oranges lending a subtle freshness to the timeless elegance, because beauty derives not from fashion but from style. The citrus notes lie on a base of sweet fruits, like pineapple and lovely and sweetscented flowers like jasmine, violet and rose, strongly reverberated by the unique force of amber. The stylistic construction gracefully rests on a powerful base note of precious woods such as sandal and white oud sweetened and emphasised by the vertical depth of Musk. A perfume that has been used throughout the history of Italian luxury artistic perfumery, reinterpreted by the artisan skill and by the love that only unique products, carefully and slowly created one by one by hand, are able to give only to those who are sufficiently sensitive to appreciate them. A limited collection offered only to those who truly have the elective affinity to understand the timeless value of beauty and very sophisticated elegance, contained forever in the simplicity of a drop of liquid emotion.\n\nTOP NOTES: Pineapple, Orange, Bergamot & Mandarin\nMIDDLE NOTES: Jasmine, Rose, Oxygen, Violet & Oriental\nBASE NOTES: Oud, Birchwood, Sandalwood & Musk",

The nose behind this fragrance is Marc Zini.\n\n“The strength of dry sand winds. A bright game of light. Fiery leather. A caress of emerald reflections. Majestic and nearly insolent petals, coming into bloom while facing the elements of Nature.” It is with those words that the brand's founder and owner, Thibaud Crivelli, describes his most striking encounter with iris flowers. A wild, untouched setting where this delicate flower unveiled its most inner strength. The powdery trails of those fragile flowers echoing with verdant, dry, animalic and soft notes. A unique sensorial capture, which gives Iris Malikhân an asserted and contemporary signature.\"",

    "description": "Papyrus Moleculaire by Maison Crivelli is a Floral Woody Musk fragrance for women and men. Papyrus Moleculaire was launched in 2020. The nose behind this fragrance is Leslie Girard.\n\n\"Thibaud Crivelli discovered papyrus powder during an unexpected encounter with a group of women who were smoking cigarillos. The impromptu character of the moment, along with its feminine/virile duality, led him to work on a gender-free perfume highlighting a raw material little-known in Haute Perfumery. Papyrus, which has warm, woody, spicy and smoky notes, here reveals its more transparent, powdery yet spicy aspects. A strong signature with highly contrasting notes provides a rebellious perfume reflecting this stolen moment!\n\nPapyrus twist, carrot twirl, indigo grip. Incandescent roots, coriander boost, ground amyris. Strong character, powdery skin. Peppery tonka, a hint of cigar: rebellious sweetness, peals of laughter.\n\nPapyrus lies at the heart of this perfume. The spicy, original notes of this raw material are coupled with and heightened by a lively piquant duo of elemi and pepper. An aromatic raw material with green facets, elemi is accentuated by a touch of coriander, which adds a truly original head note. The papyrus heart of the perfume reveals a woody note of iris, while a soft amyris facet is enlivened by powdery carrot seed. The base sees tonka bean extend the rounded woods, as its hay facet combines with tobacco leaves. Meanwhile, frankincense boosts the pepper and powdery notes. From the heart through to the base, each raw material completes this unique and complex accord.\" - a note from the brand.\n\n\"I wanted to take a different approach to working on a papyrus-based fragrance. This wood is usually combined with very oriental notes and oud. I wanted to create a contrast between hot and cold, with the fresh, effusive notes of coriander leaf, followed by the spicy aspect of elemi, and the intense, smoky woody side of papyrus. This composition is warmed by a milky, musky amyris, which has entrancing notes of cigar. I added a hint of iris and powder to bring a touch of elegance and sensuality to the perfume.\" - Leslie Girard, the perfumer.",

    "description": "Lys Sølaberg by Maison Crivelli is a Woody Floral Musk fragrance for women and men. Lys Sølaberg was launched in 2021. The nose behind this fragrance is Nathalie Feisthauer. Top notes are Quince, Carrot Seeds, Wine Lees and Bergamot; middle notes are Dried Fruits, Lily, Iris and Calamus; base notes are Smoke, Ambroxan, Oak, Cedar, Guaiac Wood, Tobacco, Mate, Labdanum, Oakmoss and Patchouli.\n\n\"The lily that made the biggest impression on me was one that I came across after several hours spent walking through damp marshes strewn with tall grasses and scattered flowers. That day, as usual in the region, the weather was highly unpredictable. Gusts of wind carried back and forth the rain-charged clouds covering the valleys we were walking through. Then the sun appeared again as if by magic. Along the way, we caught sight of numerous waterfalls flowing down dark granite walls. Our final destination was a village on the cliff edge, facing the sea. We reached it around midnight. And yet, although it was the middle of summer, the sun still hadn’t set. In the distance, we could see rays of sun illuminating the waves, creating an iridescent shimmer. I remember taking shelter for a moment between two wooden houses with thatched roofs. And right there, at that very spot, I was surprised to see some lilies.\"\n\nMidnight sun, a delicious cascade. A fjord in flower, candied quince. Smoky iridescent lily. A verdant vault. A granite bridge, peat mantle. Casks of grilled oak. \n\nLys Sølaberg opens on a luminous and slightly liqueur-like fruity note, provided by an accord of bergamot, wine lees and quince. The heart sees the smoky and spicy facets of the lily accentuated by a note of calamus. The luminous top note is reinforced by the iridescent, pearlescent facet of an iris-carrot seed duo. The latter envelops the flower with a fruity roundness, which itself is accentuated by a dried fruit accord. Ambroxan, which plays an important role in the formula, introduces a highly complex woody base. The smoky aspect of the lily is prolonged by guaiac wood, while the natural feel of the perfume is accentuated by oak moss absolute, patchouli, cedar, tobacco absolute and maté. Lastly, an amber accord, built around labdanum and an absolute of roasted oak shavings, reinforces the truly original character of the perfume.\n\n\"Working on this fragrance, I was lucky enough to be given total freedom to express my interpretation of the memory Thibaud had shared. What struck me most, was this very original aesthetic vision of nature. I wanted to transcribe the remarkable beauty of the fjords, with the sun shimmering on the sea, the sweet smoky aspect of the lilies, the power of the wind, the mineral stone, and the darker, more humid aspect of the peat. I wanted to convey the idea of Mankind faced with rugged nature. And so there is a real duality in this creation. It opens with a beautiful pearlescent light to begin with, then evolves towards a note that evokes the power of the elements, which is almost telluric, and not at all fragile. The creation expresses itself and evolves in contrasts between the smoky, spicy lily facet, the radiant, slightly alcoholised quince, and a peaty/woody facet provided by the amber woods and an overdose of ambroxan, as well as an absolute of roasted oak shavings, which adds a remarkable, strong and incredibly sensual patina to the accord.\" - Nathalie Feisthauer.",

    "description": "Baccarat Rouge 540 Extrait de Parfum by Maison Francis Kurkdjian is a Oriental Floral fragrance for women and men. Baccarat Rouge 540 Extrait de Parfum was launched in 2017. The nose behind this fragrance is Francis Kurkdjian. Top notes are Bitter Almond and Saffron; middle notes are Egyptian Jasmine and Virginia Cedar; base notes are Ambergris, Woody Notes, Musk, Ambroxan and Cashmeran.\n\nBaccarat Rouge 540 extrait de parfum intensifies the radiance of the three auras found in the eau de parfum without betraying the original inspiration. The perfumer’s mastered craft and the wisdom gained with time gave birth to this woody extrait de perfume, an ultimate accomplishment for Francis Kurkdjian. The Grandiflorum jasmine head note gently underscores the craftsman’s voice. The hint of fire is enhanced with powdered epicurean facets of bitter almond. Lastly, the mineral note built around ambergris is tamed with an ambery and woody accord. Adding to the intensity of the extrait, the perfume bottle also plays with light. Its aesthetic dons a brilliant red robe reminiscent of Baccarat red. Baccarat Rouge 540 Maison Francis Kurkdjian extrait de parfum embodies the profusion and fusion of elements that can only be tamed by the art of the perfumer and the wisdom gained with time.",

    "description": "Pirates' Grand Reserve by Atkinsons is a Oriental Spicy fragrance for women and men. Pirates' Grand Reserve was launched in 2017. Top notes are Rum, Vanilla, Cacao, Heliotrope and Jasmine; middle notes are Virginia Cedar, Cardamom, Clary Sage, Broom and Geranium; base notes are Cashmeran, Patchouli, Musk and Moss.\n\nA new addition to The Contemporary Collection, Pirates’ Grande Reserve comes out in 2017.  Its enticing rum-and-chocolate signature is the very essence of expedition and discovery, vibrant with the thrill – and danger – of the high seas.\n\n\"Pirates’ Grand Reserve is a rich, adventurous brew of brigands and buccaneers. Chocolate and gloriously aged rum pay delicious homage to English gentlemanpirate Sir Francis Drake, who sailed around the world under Queen Elizabeth I’s flag. As daring and romantic as the legendary explorer, Pirates’ Grand Reserve puts a dangerously intoxicating spin on a perfumery favourite: rum. Full-bodied, fullblooded and, full speed ahead, Pirates’ is a fragrance to walk the plank for.\"\n\nTop notes: rum, cacao, vanilla, heliotrope, jasmine\nHeart: Virginia cedar, geranium, clary sage, broom, cardamom\nBase: patchouli, helvetolide, cashmerean, moss\n\nAvailable as a 100 ml EDP.",

Top notes are Black Tea and Cloves; middle notes are Sandalwood, Cedar and Leather; base notes are Laotian Oud, Vanilla and Liquidambar.\n\nATKINSONS in collaboration with PerfumeHolding is launching two new fragrances of the collection The Oud. The collection is dedicated to oud and reflects the idyllic chapter of time when two large and powerful civilizations, England and the Orient, were intertwined perfectly. Fragrances of the collection are inspired by romantic desert intrigues of sheiks, kings and emissaries, as well as by rare and precious types of oud, reminding us this time of Gertrude Bell, Victorian queen of desert and Faisal I, the legendary Arabic king.\n\n\"The smoky power of His Majesty The Oud is every bit the bold equal of its protagonist, King Faisal I. Confidante of Gertrude Bell, and trusted ally of Lawrence of Arabia, Faisal was a natural leader and a legendary figure of Arabian history.\n\nOf princely Bedouin lineage, he fought, charmed, and negotiated with brilliance. His charisma and fierce elegance are perfectly matched in what can only be described as an epic fragrance. The intense smokiness of the scent is the bold alliance of a rare and exclusive quality of natural oud essence from Laos together with an exceptionally complex lapsang souchong tea accord. Conjuring up the scent of the saddles of Arabian stallions, the Lapsang Souchong accord inprints its smoky and leathery nuances onto the voluptuous woodiness of Cedarwood & Sandalwood, Surrendering only to the hypnotic aura of Oud and vanilla.\n\nThe ensemble creates a fragrance of intensely masculine refinement, daring in its olfactive conception, as focused and penetrating as the famous desert gaze of the king.\"\n\nFragrances Her Majesty The Oud and His Majesty The Oud are available in luxurious flacons in gold, as a 100ml Eau de Parfum.",

Beach Walk opens with citruses – bergamot and lemon, and develops with pink pepper, ylang-ylang, coconut milk, musk and heliotrope.\n\nThe fragrances are poured into classical, simple bottles similar to those in apothecaries, while their outer carton is illustrated with a photograph reflecting the topic of each of the fragrances.\n\nAll three perfumes are available starting from the end of June 2012, as 100 ml eau de toilette.",

Exhaust blowing on cotton candy.\nFunny circus, absurd circle. It reminds me of knowing sweetness when I was their age. Strawberry jam and raspberry yoghurt. It was all so good but I couldn’t know it.\nThen this metallic screech interrupted it all. The abrupt brake on youth. Hot, torn rubber marked so all could see. Born out of petrol on a back seat.\nI was all so fast and loud, and the car couldn’t reverse again.\n\nNow I’m parked in a hospital. Hope they have something sweet in store for me.",

When I was a child and I would find them, I’d keep them until I saw the first well and I would make a wish.\nBut now money doesn’t make wishes come true, and there is no well. They dried up. Father told me the holy water font became mouldy. Marble cracked and prayers turned to dust on walls.\nBut I still have my hope. I know rain will come and I will melt in the soil I walked on and nature will bring nurture. And more shall live again.",

Everything is a part of me and my message can be perceived by all senses that touch your soul: visual, tactile, flagrant and musical.\nThe story of the name is a mystery that you can read only on the back of the label, through the oil. My grandma’s passing had a strong impact on me, as a 7 year old boy and the feeling of grief inspired me to create this perfume.\nThe smell of incense and summer flowers that are slowly drying in the sun are remembered in the fragrance.\nThe leather label represents the pain that I endured and overcame, becoming stronger every day.\nThe peppercorn smell compliments the aroma well and 7 of them can be found in the bottle as my lucky number is 7. The motto is placed casually on the front of the bottle but delivers the strongest message: God is everywhere and I believe in Him.\n\nThe box has been packed with the same attention to detail that characterize the product, containing 6 hand made postcards. Each image was crafted by my tattoo artist and is imprinted in my skin.\nYou can also find my favorite playlist to fully immerse you in the experience.",

Just like the films they put on for me.\nA favorite of mine said I am part of the “children of Karl Marx and Coca Cola”. I’m not sure what he meant, but I never want to forget again. The characters burned so fast only the cigarette butts remained.\nWe held hands. Children were conceived in that cinema, and grown-ups turned back.\n\nSomeone gave me a light.",

I remember eating this small lemon tart on my first flight ever. They took me to a theme park when I was 5 and I smudged it.\nThere are lilacs knocking on the windows now, just like then. The rooms used to seem so big back then, and life so colorful. The linens smelled so calm. It was spring and the garden by our hotel room was in full blossom.\nI remember playing with my toys, staying inside… It was never-ending, unlike the rides.\n\nI remember the screams and their hugs. Twenty years fly by but I don’t seem to…",

    "description": "724 by Maison Francis Kurkdjian is a fragrance for women and men. 724 was launched in 2022. The nose behind this fragrance is Francis Kurkdjian. Top notes are Aldehydes and Calabrian bergamot; middle notes are Egyptian Jasmine, Mock Orange and Sweet Pea; base notes are White Musk and Sandalwood.\n\nIn the light of a pure sky rising over the city ascends the elegant silhouette of 724. Urban landscapes and their surrounding architecture overtly influenced the graphic aesthetic of this musky floral Eau de parfum. Luminous, vibrant, and comfortably addictive, 724 invites you to feel the city rhythm. In the top notes, a fresh, urban accord is perceived. It is the sensation of clean, energizing freshness, formed of bergamot from Italy and the verticality of aldehydes with sophisticated, slightly metallic, effervescent facets. At the heart of this fragrance lies an airy aura conveyed by a bouquet structured by jasmine absolute from Egypt, sweet pea, and mock orange. In the base notes, this universe of whiteness surrenders to an enveloping, comforting sensation thanks to sandalwood and white musk accord.\n\nWHITE SANDALWOOD: This Indian wood is considered to be sacred. It is mentioned in many Sanskrit texts and is still burned in Asia during religious celebrations. For perfumers, the Santalum album growing in India, China and Indonesia is the reference, even if there are now two other varieties cultivated in Australia and New Caledonia. The Indian quality is often referred to as Mysore because it is the historical region in the south of the peninsula that produces the largest amount. The oil distilled from the ten-meter tree is rare and expensive, because it takes more than 50 years to obtain a tree that can be used in perfumery. Its low volatility makes it a very persistent base note. Its fragrance is woody, milky, slightly spicy, round, soft and enveloping.\n\nALDEHYDES: Aldehydes are synthetic compounds that have been used in perfumery since the beginning of the 20th century, and they have very different olfactory characteristics from one another. They can alternately evoke citrus smells (orange, tangerine), soapy smells, or metallic smells reminiscent of a hot iron (steam from the laundry, etc.). Often associated with floral notes, they introduce an effervescent, sophisticated freshness as well as undeniable volume, and they also linger for longer.\n\nBERGAMOT FROM CALABRIA: Known for its fruity edge in Earl Grey tea, Citrus Bergamia is widely used in perfumery because its fresh, sparkling top notes bring a kind of \"smile\" to the perfume. Its oil is obtained by cold expression of the fruit's peel. Southern Italy specializes in the cultivation of this citrus fruit, used in the composition of eau de Cologne and of many women's and men's fragrances, with fresh, floral and aromatic facets unfolding and stretching all the way into the heart of the perfume.\n\nBOUQUET OF FRESH FLOWERS: It is a bouquet of aerial flowers, just picked and barely open, imagined by Francis Kurkdjian. To do this, he reconstituted a seringa, also called the poets' jasmine, with a scent oscillating between orange blossom and fresh jasmine. Then he reproduced the effects of two other mute flowers, the luminous freesia and lily of the valley, and blended them together. The green lily of the valley note magnifies citrus fragrances and leaves an airy floral sensation.\n\nJASMINE FROM EGYPT: Known by its Latin name as jasminum grandiflorum, the jasmine used in perfumery is surprisingly potent and multi-faceted, ranging from orangey-floral, solar, fruity (banana, strawberry, apricot), to animalic and spicy. Jasmine has an astonishingly complex structure for such a fragile flower that needs to be harvested very early in the morning before the sun spoils its fragrance. Its scent can only be extracted with volatile solvents and is very expensive due to its low yield of essential oil. Its kaleidoscope of nuances blends perfectly with other flowers as well as woods or ambery accords.\n\nMUSKS: Initially extracted from Tibetan musk deers, natural musk has been banned in perfumery since 1973. Synthetic molecules designed to replace it appeared at the end of the 19th century, so today there is a wide selection of musky notes with an olfactory palette ranging from fruity, to woody to animal facets. Musks are very persistent and relatively non-volatile base notes. They have been extensively used in detergents and fabric softeners, and are commonly referred to as white musks because they evoke the scent of soft, fluffy clean linen, and conjure up a feeling of tenderness and comfort suitable for all kinds of fragrances. With their inimitable mellowness highly appreciated by the general public, today musky notes are present in the vast majority of women's and men's perfumes.\n\n\"There is something about big cities that sweeps over you, electrifies you, elevates you. I translated that communicative energy, that life pulsating in unison, into a fragrance.\" - said Francis Kurkdjian.\n\n724 fragrance is available as 35ml, 70ml and 200ml Eau de Parfum.",

    "description": "Hacivat by Nishane is a Chypre fragrance for women and men. Hacivat was launched in 2017. The nose behind this fragrance is Jorge Lee. Top notes are Pineapple, Grapefruit and Bergamot; middle notes are Cedar, Patchouli and Jasmine; base notes are Oakmoss and Woody Notes.\n\n“For the collection named as “SHADOW PLAY” launched in 2017, NISHANE has got the main inspiration from the traditional shadow play which is also known as shadow puppetry, an ancient form of storytelling and entertainment which uses flat articulated cut-out figures (shadow puppets) which are held between a source of light and a translucent screen or scrim. The cut-out shapes of the puppets sometimes include translucent color or other types of detailing. Various effects can be achieved by moving both the puppets and the light source. A talented puppeteer can make the figures appear to walk, dance, fight, nod and laugh.\n\nKARAGOZ (meaning “black eye” in Turkish) and HACIVAT (shortened in time from \"Hacı İvaz\" meaning \"İvaz the Pilgrim\"), ZENNE (the common name of the generally beautiful and flirty women featuring in various plays) are the lead characters of the traditional Turkish shadow play, popularized during the Ottoman period and then spread to most nation states that comprised the Ottoman Empire and most prominently in Turkey and Greece. The creative directors Mert Güzel and Murat Katran dreamed of bringing the legend of Karagoz & Hacivat into the today’s world. Under the inspiration of their playful characters, the perfume trilogy has been created together with the perfumer Jorge Lee. Just like the theme of these shadow plays, the main objective of NISHANE was to emphasize the contrasting interaction of the people that we can see in every single culture.\n\nHACIVAT is a tribute to elegance, competence, and love of art.\n\nZENNE is a tribute to beauty, self-confidence, and flirtation.\n\nKARAGOZ is a tribute to wittiness, straightforwardness and sincerity” — press release of the brand.",

    "description": "Wulong Cha X by Nishane is a fragrance for women and men. Wulong Cha X was launched in 2023. The nose behind this fragrance is Julien Rasquinet. Top notes are Bergamot, Yuzu, Litsea Cubeba and Mandarin Orange; middle notes are Green Tea, Magnolia and Thyme; base notes are Musk and Fig.\n\nIncluded in the first-ever NISHANE collection launched globally in the year 2015, WŪLÓNG CHÁ has reached a huge fanbase worldwide thanks to the journey it takes the wearer to the serene tea gardens of the Far East, where the delicate notes of oolong tea leaves and Mediterranean fig fill the air. The original WŪLÓNG CHÁ has been celebrated mainly because of its robust power of refreshing notes. However, WŪLÓNG CHÁ X is designed to mute the sharp edges of the original formula and enhance it with the addition of florals namely magnolia. This fragrance opens with a burst of zesty citrus notes of bergamot, orange, mandarin, and yuzu, transporting the wearer to the sunny shores of the Mediterranean. As the scent settles, the heart notes of magnolia, thyme oil, and green tea weave a magical spell around you, evoking the tranquil stillness of a teatime. Finally, the musk and fig base notes provide a warm and grounding finish to this fragrance that will keep the wearer feeling fresh and revitalized all day.\n\nTOP NOTES\n\nbergamot - yuzu - litsea - mandarin\n\nHEART NOTES\n\nmagnolia - thyme oil - green tea\n\nBASE NOTES\n\nmusk - fig",

Top notes are Black Currant, Rhubarb and Grapefruit; middle notes are Turkish Rose, Gardenia and Sandalwood; base notes are Vanilla, Ambergris and Musk.\n\n“For the collection named as “SHADOW PLAY” launched in 2017, NISHANE has got the main inspiration from the traditional shadow play which is also known as shadow puppetry, an ancient form of storytelling and entertainment which uses flat articulated cut-out figures (shadow puppets) which are held between a source of light and a translucent screen or scrim. The cut-out shapes of the puppets sometimes include translucent color or other types of detailing. Various effects can be achieved by moving both the puppets and the light source. A talented puppeteer can make the figures appear to walk, dance, fight, nod and laugh.\n\nKARAGOZ (meaning “black eye” in Turkish) and HACIVAT (shortened in time from \"Hacı İvaz\" meaning \"İvaz the Pilgrim\"), ZENNE (the common name of the generally beautiful and flirty women featuring in various plays) are the lead characters of the traditional Turkish shadow play, popularized during the Ottoman period and then spread to most nation states that comprised the Ottoman Empire and most prominently in Turkey and Greece. The creative directors Mert Güzel and Murat Katran dreamed of bringing the legend of Karagoz & Hacivat into the today’s world. Under the inspiration of their playful characters, the perfume trilogy has been created together with the perfumer Jorge Lee. Just like the theme of these shadow plays, the main objective of NISHANE was to emphasize the contrasting interaction of the people that we can see in every single culture.\n\nHACIVAT is a tribute to elegance, competence, and love of art.\n\nZENNE is a tribute to beauty, self-confidence, and flirtation.\n\nKARAGOZ is a tribute to wittiness, straightforwardness and sincerity” — press release of the brand.",

    "description": "Karagoz by Nishane is a Aromatic Fruity fragrance for women and men. Karagoz was launched in 2017. The nose behind this fragrance is Jorge Lee. Top notes are Grapes, Pineapple and Herbal Notes; middle notes are Neroli, Patchouli and Jasmine; base notes are Vetiver, Agarwood (Oud) and Amber.\n\n“For the collection named as “SHADOW PLAY” launched in 2017, NISHANE has got the main inspiration from the traditional shadow play which is also known as shadow puppetry, an ancient form of storytelling and entertainment which uses flat articulated cut-out figures (shadow puppets) which are held between a source of light and a translucent screen or scrim. The cut-out shapes of the puppets sometimes include translucent color or other types of detailing. Various effects can be achieved by moving both the puppets and the light source. A talented puppeteer can make the figures appear to walk, dance, fight, nod and laugh.\n\nKARAGOZ (meaning “black eye” in Turkish) and HACIVAT (shortened in time from \"Hacı İvaz\" meaning \"İvaz the Pilgrim\"), ZENNE (the common name of the generally beautiful and flirty women featuring in various plays) are the lead characters of the traditional Turkish shadow play, popularized during the Ottoman period and then spread to most nation states that comprised the Ottoman Empire and most prominently in Turkey and Greece. The creative directors Mert Güzel and Murat Katran dreamed of bringing the legend of Karagoz & Hacivat into the today’s world. Under the inspiration of their playful characters, the perfume trilogy has been created together with the perfumer Jorge Lee. Just like the theme of these shadow plays, the main objective of NISHANE was to emphasize the contrasting interaction of the people that we can see in every single culture.\n\nHACIVAT is a tribute to elegance, competence, and love of art.\n\nZENNE is a tribute to beauty, self-confidence, and flirtation.\n\nKARAGOZ is a tribute to wittiness, straightforwardness and sincerity” — press release of the brand.",

    "description": "Interlude Man by Amouage is a Oriental Woody fragrance for men. Interlude Man was launched in 2012. The nose behind this fragrance is Pierre Negrin. Top notes are Oregano, Pepper and Bergamot; middle notes are Incense, Opoponax, Amber and Labdanum; base notes are Agarwood (Oud), Leather, Sandalwood and Patchouli.\n\nAmouage presents a new pair of fragrances by the name of Interlude. Interlude Woman and Interlude Man are said to evoke an air of disorder while maintaining a sense of balance and tranquility through the inventive use of incense and myrrh.\n\nChristopher Chong said: “I interpret what I see and feel into scents. All the social and natural chaos and disorder surrounding us today can be translated to a much more intimate level. The interlude moment is a reflection of all the trials and tribulations one overcomes to attain personal satisfaction and achievement.” He also explained the use of ingredients: “Amouage has established an enviable reputation for re-inventing accustomed scents. Frankincense and Myrrh traditionally smell spiritual and religious but in Interlude, they have been reconstructed to feel contemporary yet sophisticated.”\n\nInterlude Man is a spicy – woody fragrance that opens with zesty bergamot, oregano and pimento berry oil, perpetuating intervals of conflict which are countered by aromatic notes of amber, frankincense, opoponax, cistus and myrrh. Eternal notes of leather, agarwood smoke, patchouli and sandalwood in the base add lasting layers of depth and texture. Perfumer: Pierre Negrin.\n\nAmouage’s signature glass crystal bottles are colored in a rich and mesmerizing midnight blue hue with gold plated decorations, accentuated with a sapphire blue Swarovski crystal. The outer packaging is designed in vibrant colors that show orderly chaos in abstract and conceptual representation.\n\nThe fragrances are available as 50 ml and 100 ml Eau de Parfum.",

A fountain gleams in the centre, its marble edge covered in scarlet roses whose voluptuous scent meets that of leathery Saffron threads laid on the floor.\n \nThrough Jasmine screens, sultry and spent, the woman walks and there comes with her a scent of dark Vanilla and skinlike Sandalwood, of ambery Labdanum and purring hints of regal Orientalgris: who are you, she asks, and you feel seen.\n \nA spellbinding and novel interpretation of the Amouage triad of Rose, Frankincense and Orientalgris, Guidance reads like a poem, smells like an embrace, and feels like a word of wisdom.",

Top notes are Rhuburb, Pepper and Coriander; middle notes are Gardenia, Tuberose, Jasmine, Lily-of-the-Valley and Carnation; base notes are Amber, Incense, Opoponax, Vetiver and Leather.\n\nAmouage presents a new fragrant pair in 2011 - Honour Woman and Honour Man. These perfumes are dedicated to the tragic story of Madame Butterfly, the geisha Cio-Cio-San who married an American and waited for his return for three years. More specifically, the inspiration for the new creations was drawn from the last act of the eponymous opera in which Madame commits suicide.\n\nHonour Woman is a fragrance of white flowers and resins. White flowers symbolize the progress of unrequited love. The composition was created by Alexandra Carlin and Violaine Collas. Top notes are spices of pepper, rhubarb and coriander. The heart captures flowers of tuberose, jasmine, gardenia, lily of the valley and carnation. The base is oriental with notes of frankincense, vetiver, opoponax, amber and leather.\n\nAvailable as 50 and 100 ml EDP:",

    "description": "Interlude Woman by Amouage is a Chypre Floral fragrance for women. Interlude Woman was launched in 2012. The nose behind this fragrance is Karine Vinchon Spehner. Top notes are Marigold, Ginger, Grapefruit and Bergamot; middle notes are Incense, Walnut, Immortelle, Kiwi, Honey, Opoponax, Coffee, Sandalwood, Rose, Orange Blossom and Jasmine; base notes are Leather, Benzoin, Agarwood (Oud), Amber, Sandalwood, Tonka Bean, Oakmoss, Vanilla and Musk.\n\nAmouage presents a new pair of fragrances by the name of Interlude. Interlude Woman and Interlude Man are said to evoke an air of disorder while maintaining a sense of balance and tranquility through the inventive use of incense and myrrh.\n\nChristopher Chong said: “I interpret what I see and feel into scents. All the social and natural chaos and disorder surrounding us today can be translated to a much more intimate level. The interlude moment is a reflection of all the trials and tribulations one overcomes to attain personal satisfaction and achievement.” He also explained the use of ingredients: “Amouage has established an enviable reputation for re-inventing accustomed scents. Frankincense and Myrrh traditionally smell spiritual and religious but in Interlude, they have been reconstructed to feel contemporary yet sophisticated.”\n\nInterlude Woman is a floral chypre fragrance that reveals an interlude moment of unity and serenity. The sweetness of bergamot and bitterness of grapefruit in the top notes (together with ginger and tagete) create turbulent tensions while rose, frankincense, jasmine, orange blossom, helichrysum, opoponax and sandalwood in the intricate heart are masqueraded with an unconventional combination of nut, coffee, kiwi, honey and agarwood. An opulent base of sumptuous vanilla, benzoin, amber, sandalwood, oakmoss, leather, tonka and musk inject warmth to the fragrance’s contradicting accords. Perfumer: Karine Vinchon Spehner.\n\nAmouage’s signature glass crystal bottles are colored in a rich and mesmerizing midnight blue hue with gold plated decorations, accentuated with a sapphire blue Swarovski crystal. The outer packaging is designed in vibrant colors that show orderly chaos in abstract and conceptual representation.\n\nThe fragrances are available as 50 ml and 100 ml Eau de Parfum.",

Its simple, limpid script underscores the natural beauty and richness of two of perfumery’s most legendary ingredients. The freshness of rose and the woody depths of oud exalt one another, borne aloft by a warm swirl of ambergris.\"\n\nLouis Vuitton Les Sables Roses is available as a 100 and 200 ml Eau de Parfum.",

A floral wave of white Sambac jasmine and tuberose is placed in contrast with the mysterious and deep notes of tonka bean and cocoa.\n\nThe face of the perfume is model Karlie Kloss. The fragrance comes in an elegant black stiletto shaped bottle as a 50 and 80 ml Eau de Parfum.\n\nGood Girl is created by perfumers Louise Turner and Quentin Bisch.",

    "description": "Very Good Girl by Carolina Herrera is a Floral Fruity fragrance for women. Very Good Girl was launched in 2021. Very Good Girl was created by Quentin Bisch, Louise Turner and Shyamala Maisondieu. Top notes are Litchi and Red Currant; middle note is Rose; base notes are Vanilla and Vetiver.\n\nAt the beginning of February 2021, Carolina Herrera presents a new flanker in an attractive bright red stiletto bottle. Red is definitely a trend in 2021 because many houses have decided to offer new creations in red bottles. It is composed by Quentin Bisch, Louise Turner and Shyamala Maisondieu.\n\nVery Good Girl is a new olfactory adventure that takes a surprising turn: Where previous fragrances in the family explored the subversive power of jasmine or the tonka bean, this new Eau de Parfum ups the ante, drawing its strength from the potency of the rose, a distinctive scent, which here treads on entirely new ground.\n\nVERY GOOD GIRL arrives after last year's creation, Good Girl Suprême, and Good Girl Légère from 2018. They stand out as different compositions from the other editions of the collection, which were limited edition bottles of the original Good Girl creation from 2016.\n\nAs the brand explains: \"Rose and vetiver: an idyllic contrast. Very Good Girl is a Floral Fruity fragrance. Its aromatic journey starts with the currant, a playfully mischievous wild berry that’s joined by the exotic lychee in a unity of confidence. It’s at this point that the singular yet mysterious qualities of the rose come into play. As one of the most important raw ingredients in the history of perfumery, it has previously seen countless interpretations. All-encompassing and seductive, its unique scent is an ace up any sleeve, which is exactly what perfumers Quentin Bisch and Louise Turner capitalized on for this new chapter in the Good Girl universe.\"\n\n\"Here, it’s the creamy and powdery nuances of the rose that come to the fore, with an indulgent romanticism that’s as warm and silky as the world’s most seductive red lipstick.\n\nThere’s no need to justify a declaration of love for this most luxurious of ingredients, and even if this were reason enough to create a fragrance, Quentin Bisch and Louise Turner are anything but a conformist. Hence why the final burst in Very Good Girl is a veiled background of vetiver, the raw form of which evokes the smell of wood, and is often used in men’s perfumery. It’s a key ingredient of Bad Boy, for example, but also of Good Girl Suprême, providing a surprising and contemporary counterpoint that in this new fragrance creates an alliance with the warmth of vanilla.\n\nThe result is a floral fragrance that enhances the natural beauty of its raw ingredients, but without forgoing creativity.\"\n\nAs Carolina Herrera famously said, “Fashion is evolution, not revolution,” a maxim that fully applies to this new fragrance. Just as when Wes Gordon modernizes timeless materials such as silk or leather when designing fashion for the brand, the rose is used with a completely contemporary aesthetic. This is why Very Good Girl is not only a tour de force for the senses, it’s also a fragrance that’s ready to wear and enjoy in the modern world.\n\nThe red bottle is not the first in the collection, but it differs in design. Good Girl Velvet Fatale was the first red fragrance of the collection made in a bottle of dark red velvet, while the new creation is as shiny and glassy as the original edition. The true fans of the line now have a new object of desire. VERY GOOD GIRL comes on the market in mid-February in 50ml and 80ml Eau de Parfum bottles.",

Top notes are Lavender and Pink Pepper; middle notes are Plum and Geranium; base notes are Cedar, Vetiver, Truffle and Oak.\n\nFollowing the global success of Bad Boy and Bad Boy Le Parfum, Carolina Herrera puts an electrifying twist on the dual nature of the modern man with Bad Boy Cobalt. This new men’s fragrance cracks open convention while exploring the diverse bonds of brotherhood, embodied in nature by the unapologetic strength found in cobalt and its powerfully pigmented blue. Working closely with Carolina A. Herrera, Creative Director of fragrances at Carolina Herrera, Perfumer Domitille Michalon Bertier delved into the depths of her imagination to develop this technically accomplished perfume. Together, they fused mineral sexiness and wild freshness for an energizing and contrasted new release, which is contained in a fresh cobalt blue conceptualization of the already iconic Bad Boy lightning bolt perfume bottle. Every fragrance has dominant notes that allow its message to be transmitted, giving it its soul and unique signature.\n\nFor Bad Boy Cobalt, the team chose to work with the incredible contrasts of the new “Magic Spark ELIXIR”, an ingredient that elegantly expresses the complementary contradictions of brotherhood, the nuance, and strength of a friendship between men. Just as cobalt dyes glass that particular shade of blue, this ELIXIR colors the fragrance from top to bottom with lively citrus accents, simultaneously producing intriguingly earthy undertones.\n\nThe Magic Spark ELIXIR blends pink pepper and geranium to create the fresher part of Bad Boy Cobalt. Pink pepper offers a distinctively fresh tone with aromatic and slightly floral suggestions, while geranium is a floral yet masculine note that was a prominent part of Carolina Herrera for Men, the first masculine fragrance from the house of Herrera, first launched in 1991. The mineral accents of a truffle accord are invigorated with the literal and metaphorical strength of oakwood, and infused with the masculinity of vetiver, together with the sexiness of cedarwood to create the hooking base of the fragrance.\n\n“But it wasn’t just the symbolism of the lighting bolt that allowed my imagination to run wild,” says Domitille Michalon-Bertier. “Cobalt is found in the earth’s crust, and I found myself reflecting on lightning cracking Bad Boy Cobalt the ground open, revealing this chemical element together with the dense smells of the soil.” Oakwood, with its touch of smokiness, is a historical symbol of endurance, “beautifully representing the enduring strength within a band of brothers” to the creator of Bad Boy Cobalt.\n\nMeanwhile, vetiver is a perennial plant, drawing its subtle fragrance from volcanic soil saturated with mineral salts, and is a classic ingredient of men’s perfumery. The essential oils of cedarwood has been extracted since ancient Egyptian times, here supplying a powerful dry and vibrating edge with additional clean and green facets.\n\nAt Carolina Herrera, vetiver has historically been a reference to exotic travel, to the Caribbean vistas of locations such as Haiti. Today, the House of Herrera creates this new fragrance using a vetiver sourced from Haiti, and is at the root of a program called Sourcing for Shared Value, which finds greener ways to grow and harvest this important ingredient while protecting the people who work the land by supporting with local education and infrastructure.\n\nIt’s a lengthy process to make sure that the vetiver used is the most beautiful, ethical, and greenest product for both the population and for the planet. In their distinctive ways, each fragrance in the Bad Boy family plays on the dual nature of the contemporary man, a concept that is reinforced and developed with Bad Boy Cobalt and its exploration of the bonds of brotherhood. Modern men are aware that there’s no strength without sensitivity, or power without compassion, so the short circuit of freshness in the top notes and the deep base notes of Bad Boy Cobalt are enhanced by a floral heart to the perfume.\n\nComposed of clean aromatic lavender and juicy black plum, it evokes the emotional tenderness that’s at the center of the most durable of male friendships. The powerful contrasting nature of this masculine duality is enigmatically represented by the bottle, with its blue to transparent gradient. An exquisite reimagining of the emblematic lightning bolt from the Bad Boy universe, it shows us Bad Boy at his most elegant, inspired to be himself, and confident that anything is possible alongside his trusted and beloved friends.",

The original was conceived as representation of the duality of a woman’s character, with an addictive combination of tuberose and roasted tonka bean.\n\nGood Girl Légère is a lighter, more floral version of the oriental, floral and gourmand original. It keeps the notes of jasmine, which are enhanced and enriched ylang-ylang. Tuberose is toned down, with no coffee note. The base keeps tonka bean and sandalwood in its composition.\n\nThe fragrance is available as a 30 and 50 ml Eau de Parfum Légère.",

Top notes are Bergamot and Myrtle; middle notes are Hazelnut, Chocolate and Roasted Coffee Beans; base notes are Leather and Cedar.\n\nValentino and Puig are launching a new fragrance for men for the house of Valentino, and it has been promoted recently in sunny Venice. The idea was to create a fragrance that would be a classic of the future, aiming at men who strive for classics and like casual style. They select top quality for themselves – as announced by the brand. Valentino Uomo is closely connected with fashion collection Valentino, so Rome was an excellent choice for advertising campaign of the new perfume.\n\nPerfumer Olivier Polge has signed the new creation for Valentino and created it with a traditional pyramidal concept (top, heart, base), where woody notes in the base are particularly highlighted in this edition. The composition opens with bergamot and myrtle, succeeded in the heart by roasted coffee combined with gianduja cream, on a rich base created of cedar and precious leather.\n\nValentino Uomo arrives on the market in the beginning of 2014. Advertising face of Valentino Uomo is French actor Louis Garrelm, video advertisement is directed by Johan Renck, while photos were taken by David Sims.",

    "description": "Twilight Woods by Bath & Body Works is a Floral Woody Musk fragrance for women. Twilight Woods was launched in 2009. The nose behind this fragrance is Honorine Blanc. Top notes are Wild Berries, Coconut and Mandarin Orange; middle notes are Apricot, Frangipani, Mimosa, Honeysuckle and Freesia; base notes are Woodsy Notes, Vanille, Musk, Agarwood (Oud) and Orris Root.\n\nA romantic walk in enchanted woods, captured in a fragrance. A hypnotic blend developed to instantly evoke the mystery and beauty of enchanted woods. When the sun has set and the evening begins, the unique enchantment of twilight woods is awakened through sights, sounds and scent. A new distinctly feminine fragrance, an alluring blend of bright flowers, surprising spices and creamy woods – layers upon layers of youthful luxury with an elegant touch of cashmere, captures the singular pleasure of a twilight stroll. Perfect for a cozy night in or magical night out, the intensely feminine fragrance wraps the wearer in a soothing warmth. Twilight Woods is the newest addition to Bath & Body Works’ “Cuddler” collection, a set of scents designed to make you feel cozy, comforted and relaxed.\n\nTwilight Woods joins the Signature Collection line as the latest expertly blended fragrance created by the world’s top perfumers. Among fragrance aficionados and Bath & Body Works shoppers alike, Signature Collection scents are considered a best-kept secret—carefully calibrated blends of superior ingredients for a fraction of the cost of prestige brands.\n\nThe Firmenich master perfumers behind Twilight Woods combined lush, dewy fruits with elegant, exotic woods to create an alluring, secretive scent. Perfumer Harry Fremont experimented with the scents of sustainable hardwoods, while Jane Konnyu added a layer of musk to build texture and body with a soft, feminine feel. When Honorine Blanc smelled the silk-woody combination, she craved the effect of a delicious, addictive top note, explaining, “When I added a juicy cocktail of sparkling fruits and creamy white flowers, I found I just couldn’t stop smelling it.” Twilight Woods captures the dreams and efforts of these three Firmenich masters, combining Harry’s bold use of new ingredients, Jane’s focus on femininity and softness, and Honorine’s playful modernity.\n\nTOP NOTES\n\nJuicy Berry, Sparkling Mandarin, hint of Coconut\n\nMID NOTES\n\nCreamy Frangipani, Soft Mimosa, Wet Honeysuckle, Wild Freesia, Apricot Nectar\n\nDRY NOTES\n\nOud Wood, Musk, Orris, Vanilla Milk, Warm Woods",
